"	"Hmmm— I'm a media composer. That means I write music for film, tv, video artwork, installations, etc. I also write standalone pieces but that's much more occasional. Depending on the project I and scope I do everything from sound design to recording but my main skill is composing.
"	"I use AI tools for brainstorming, asking quick questions about technique and theory, general admin, copywriting, emails/comms, and also business planning.
Oh I should mention I also use some machine learning mixing plugins like iZotope Ozone and Sonible Smart:EQ. Anyway— brainstorming is and ideation is really just a process of bouncing my ideas off a peer. Sometimes it's talking through creative blocks and trying to clarify my vision.
"	"This wasn't a client project but I've been using AI to critically analyse film scores. It's been good to get the creative thinking flowing. Basically I've been asking AI to help write out an essay on  something like the film Arrival and what made the score by Johannsson so unique.

"	"I'm a music producer and audio engineer. I work with clients to record and mix their original music. Many of my projects have been full productions - so, seeing the record through from demo to recording to mixing. With an overseas move coming up though, I won't have the same access to my current home studio, so I'm hoping to move towards doing more mixing projects, exclusively.

I also play guitar in a band and produce my own electronic music when I can
"	"I'm using it mostly for brainstorming out of creative blocks, and for troubleshooting or techy workflow questions.
So for example - when songwriting, I'm usually more instrument-first. That is, it works best for me to write full instrumentals in the DAW first, then add lyrics. Sometimes, when it comes time to add lyrics, I'll ask ChatGPT or Claude for lists of interesting word pairings. Just getting a long list to try out over the instrumental often leads to finding a hook or at least a seed for a song idea.

Another one is song names. For example, I have an EP's worth (4 tracks) of instrumental electronic music. There's themes, but little to no lyrics. Again, I'll have an LLM drop a list of thematic words or pairings to get ideas flowing for song names.
"	"Yeah so for this electronic EP. I had placeholder names for the projects, but I wanted to change a few of them. So I told ChatGPT about the themes of the tracks, and a sonic description of each song. ChatGPT already knows a lot about my projects and artist aesthetic, so it can use that info too. Then I told it the 4 working track names, what I liked, and what I didn't. We went through a few rounds of lists, but I ended up with 4 that I'm happy with

"	"My creative work is largely centred on writing SEO web content and articles, which involves using keywords to produce content that will help websites rank in search results. I also manage a small team of writers and need to regularly give updates to my manager. A typical project for me is a content request from a project manager, which will be for a specific client and requires a certain number of pages of content to be written.
"	"I find myself increasingly reaching for AI tools, especially as time goes on and its capabilities continue to improve. I use it for everything from brainstorming topic ideas and page outlines through to feeding it prompts to generate content. I also occasionally use it for proofreading and fact checking by copying in written content to check it. Occasionally I'll also reach for AI when I have to do a presentation and need help coming up with ideas and structuring the presentation.
"	"I needed to write 12 pages of content for a legal client. It's important with professional clients like these that the content is very well-written, accurate and professional. I was able to use AI for this project to craft paragraphs I could then lightly rewrite to make sound more human. I felt positive about the experience, as using AI helped me achieve a consistent tone and saved a lot of time from having to research things and write from scratch

"	"I am a dance instructor and a choreographer. On a weekly basis, I am coming up with lesson plans for children who are learning tap, jazz, and ballet. The lesson plans need to be specific to those styles, the level of the students, and (at times) the theme of the week. Something else that is very important is that the lesson plans should expand upon each other- skills learned in the previous week should be reviewed and increased in difficulty. Additionally, I create a dance combination for each class and each week. This means that I create a short piece of chorography in each of the styles that are tailored to the students' level, the choreographic style I'm going for, and sometimes other factors such as the time of year. I am developing my own choreography style, which is a slow process. Lastly, over the next few weeks, I am choreographing a few pieces for the Christmas season.
"	"I use AI tools every week to help me build out the basic structure of my classes, including, but not limited to, barre warmups, stretching sessions, across the floor and center exercises, music choices, and integration of practiced steps into choreography. I also like to ask AI to give me ideas for things that I can teach my students about dance history
"	"Yes. Recently, I asked AI to come up with a basic lesson plan for jazz courses and then to alter the difficulty level for 3 different age groups. This made me feel much less overwhelmed. Planning so many classes each week takes so much time, which I do not get paid for (I only get paid for in-person instruction). AI has saved me so much time in this area.
Before, I was spending a lot of time researching different lesson plans for each dance genre and age group. I was finding different dance syllabi on different websites and synthesizing them into ones that I would use for class. This was extrememly time consuming. AI seems to do that for me. Additionally, I am able to edit the lesson plans quickly and easily. For example, I can ask AI to make the combination more difficult or I can ask it to add more content/ time to the across the floor section of class and take it away from the barre section.

"	"I work in production management for high end TV and film. This involves being across the entire filming process from start to finish, including hiring other creatives like camera people, costume designers, set designers, writers and editors.
"	"To be honest I find that AI tools are most useful for automating admin tasks, rather than as part of the creative process. They're not currently advanced enough to be really useful for script writing, on screen graphic design, or other key creative elements. They are very helpful for things like drafting memos or research into e.g. different eras of fashion for costume design, which frees up more time to focus on creative work.
"	"On a recent film I worked on, we used AI to draft a formal warning letter to someone whose behaviour was not up to standard. There is no HR department on film or TV productions usually so those tasks fall to the production management team who are not necessarily HR experts, so it's helpful to use AI to draft something that has the right tone. We've also tried using it for things like generating graphics for internal comms like event invitations, but it didn't work too well for that - I haven't found an AI model that's capable of producing a document with both coherent text and strong images together yet.

"	"Totally. Over the past 6 months, I began to work closely with the social media side of things at my Martial Arts locations (they're sister schools). I pretty much run the show, I come up with content ideas, film, edit, generate captions/hashtags, post and even respond to comments. Right now, we're primarily focused on Meta apps (Instagram and Facebook) but I do light work on Google Business and have recently begun to integrate our reels over to TikTok. Its a lot of fun, especially because I'm always learning something. I came to this job with literally no prior knowledge besides having some of my own videos on TikTok go viral. Projects vary, as I'm always trying new things, but we do have a consistent ""Student of the Week,"" segment I prepare for all content, including OptiSigns.
"	"All. The. Time. hahaha! ChatGPT is my best friend when it comes to caption generating. *I really hate *
My bad, I'm gonna be so honest I accidentally started italicizing my words and was trying to fix it hahahaha. I really hate coming up with captions, especially because I'm posting so many different types of content every single day between two schools. It can be very taxing, especially because I also am an instructor/manager of one location and that is my primary role. By being able to just spit out what is racing through my head and have a LLM generate the perfect captions, even adhering to shifting things slightly for different forms on content is incredible. I sometimes will go as far as hashtag generating, but I still feel like AI needs some work on that. Occasionally, I will use AI for straight up ideas, but rarely. I find in my experience AI doesn't pick up on the trends fast enough to make meaningful video ideas.
"	"Sure! Often, like I said previously, is I really just start spit balling out what I'm looking for in a caption. Most recently, I made a video targeted towards beginners. It was just some clips from our beginner KB class and the video read, ""POV: You're not Afraid to be a Beginner."" I really wanted that vibe to represent well in the caption, without sounding like I was making a sale, or being condescending. I used ChatGPT specifically for this. Its often my go-to. I find that when a long caption is needed, say for an Instagram Reel like I needed here, it does excellent and hits it on the money every time (Granted, I provide a lot of detail. My ADHD brain just goes lol) but it struggles to do the same for short, punchier captions. This can be frustrating when I'm on a time crunch (which I was at this time) This video in particular needed to be posted to Instagram and TIkTok, but it took 5 tries to get a caption I liked for TikTok that matched the vibe but was much more concise.

6	creativity_0006	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"No questions, let's begin
"	"My creative work spans the gamut! Some of it is simple as editing, however, my main writing projects typically take the form of a choose-your-own-adventure gamebook. So, essentially it has aspects of a long-form novel while also incorporating simple coding for the sake of branches and managing stats. Likewise, as a result, I sometimes end up creating supplementary graphics, concept art, etc, while worldbuilding.
"	"Personally, I incorporate AI a lot when it comes to editing my work—spellcheck and grammar, yes, but it's nice to do some sentiment analysis and summaries so that I can make sure I'm conveying what I intend to.
When in my initial drafts, I may also brainstorm with AI in order to flesh out a scene; specific sensory details, etc. I find that by having a wide list to choose from and excluding whatever doesn't feel right, I can often tap into what it is I was truly trying to convey. Likewise, I may occasionally ask my AI to take on a particular character to have a conversation about them, and then compare its interpretations to how I *feel* they would genuinely act.
 
 
When it comes to creating concept art, I may rely on it heavily for the atmospheric feeling of a space. Something that captures the ambiance and the mood, or even a simple diagram. While I'm artistically inclined myself, drawing tends to take much longer for me than writing I find that for the early planning stages, AI can help to polish my very rough drafts to a workable state without having me break my flow. That is to say, since I tend to world build in tandem with my writing (and adjust for any potential additions) using AI to generate ""moodboard"" pieces, or basic diagrams, can help me continue to the next step of my writing while having a simple foundation to draw upon.
 
So overall, I would say I use AI most in the initial and final stages of my work, with brainstorming sessions in between.
"	"Recently? I do tend to collaboratively write with AI, asking it to assume the role of a dungeon-master or character(s) while feeding it quite a bit of lore. In a way, I tend to think of the story as a sort of AU (Alternate-Universe) interpretation of my main projects, and that lets me explore potential scenarios, plotlines, and character arcs from different angles.
 
So for this in particular I was asking the AI to assume the role of various characters, each with their own unique goals, each one of them a moving part in this little microcosm. As entertainment, it was at times frustrating. The AI would forget some information in the lore, or it would misinterpret something said in the main body of text. It often takes a deal of work to break an LLM out of its sycophantic rhythms—which is integral when trying to set up genuine conflict in storylines. And often, things are resolved far too quickly. It takes a lot of careful handholding, to get the AI moving progressively forwards. Doing it long enough, you start to see the patterns in the dataset that the AI is inclined towards, patterns in cliché turns of phrase, etc, etc. It does take some of the magic away. Still, in terms of the authenticity of character portrayals or its ability to create a scene, there are times I'd find myself pleasantly surprised by how it took the loose fundamentals of a world I gave it and ran with it.
 
Honestly, overall, it's both humbling and interesting to see how much AI has evolved in terms of capabilities. I already find that AI can write better than the majority of people I know, which is great from the perspective of looking for a collaborative storyteller to simply toss ideas back and forth with, however, I also wonder if that's feeding into the ongoing existential crisis of loneliness, if humans are becoming less authentic, less emotionally-intelligent because they rely too heavily on these tools.

For the YouTube, a typical project is storyboarding the video, shooting the footage, editing, then prepping thumbnails, writing descriptions and titles, etc. For the blog, I'm outlining the content, writing it up, and integrating images and video. For church, it can be anything from sermon graphics to social images, planning and edition short-form video, etc.

I get so overwhelmed with all the ""noise"" on the internet and changing trends. Having an engine to keep up with algorithms, feature changes, and trends to point those details in the right direction is helpful. I still make sure the ""bones"" are authentically me, but being able to A/B test or use an AI checklist to score my work keeps me honest and up with the times.
"	"For a recent YouTube video, I did a side-by-side comparison between two different hair gels. I wrote up the description, but I was struggling with a catchy title (as I often do).

"	"I'm an artist and a writer with a PhD in Visual Arts. I paint and draw and make some installation art, including site-specific temporary installations. My work is typically about the natural environment. I use AI to generate photographic quality images which I go on to edit in a photo editing program such as Pixlr. I also use AI to assist in my written visual arts research, and in crafting artist statements for exhibitions.
"	"Recently I was involved in an art exhibition at a regional art gallery. I described my painting to an AI bot and asked it to generate a relevant artist statement that I could use. I could then ask for different versions of the statement, fine-tuning it by adding and subtracting different elements. For example, I could ask the AI to make a comparison of my work with a noted artist's work.
Overall, I really enjoyed the process of generating the statement, since I love reading and writing. The statement generated by AI could then be hand edited to sound more like my authentic voice as an artist. The advantage of using AI is that it makes the whole process a lot faster. It can also come up with ideas that I might not have thought of myself. Then I can tweak those ideas to make them more relevant.
Let's say that the AI was asked to compare my own paintings to the work of artist Cy Twombly - this could conventionally be seen as a bit of a stretch, since Cy Twombly's art is only mildly similar to my own. The AI model might throw up some random things that could be relevant - for example, we both use vibrant red and orange hues in our paintings. I might delete the word ""orange"" in the next version of the statement, since I would rather focus on the symbolism of the colour red. Then I can specifically ask the model to further discuss the colour red.
"	"I asked the AI to generate a diary entry based on some brief notes that I had scribbled down while I was thinking about a whole lot of random things. The model had to make sense of these notes and try to put them together in a coherent narrative. It had to write this piece in a casual, personable voice as though I was writing to myself for future reference.
It was fun to do this kind of experiment, as I like writing. I especially like recording my thoughts. The version that the AI generated didn't sound much like me though. It sounded cliché and sanitised.

"	"My work varies project to project, but usually it involves a client giving me a script or a rough idea and it's my job to bring it to life through illustration and design. I generally like to mull over what I've been given along with what the client is desiring before I start a thumbnail sketching process. Currently I'm working on illustrating two different children's books.
"	"I really like to use AI tools when I just can't find a good reference image for a pose I'm trying to capture or a lot of the times I love using AI tools when I really need extra help with composition and scene layout. It cuts my time in half having the tools to help generate these compositions.
"	"I've used it for two different projects recently, one was to help brainstorm a very specific painting for a client that involved the client's pets. I used AI to generate images of what the paintings would look like finished. Another project I used it for was to help design a book cover layout that I was pressed for time to illustrate. I will say, that AI is great for this but there are times that it doesn't quite generate exactly what I ask for, sometimes it will do its own thing and generate something similar like if I ask for two corgis in the night sky jumping over floating bananas it might give me three corgis or two corgis in the background or maybe it will give me a weird looking night sky, which can make the process longer. That part is slightly annoying.

10	creativity_0010	Content writing	2	I work on writing research style blogs t	"Sounds good - no questions from me.
"	"I run a small business/ hobby (technically a business, since I make money from it and treat it as a business) doing fantasy map commissions for independent authors and DnD players. I also create my own fantasy map assets (such as mountains, icons, trees, really anything you might find on a fantasy map) and sell them on [REDACTED], on Etsy, and a marketplace for map assets. A typical project can be one of two things: a commission involves receiving a request for a custom map from a client. They fill out the details regarding the map, and I correspond with them before, during, and after designing the map. I use digital programs such as Wonderdraft and Procreate to create this map, then I send it to the client and go through a revision process. Commissions usually take a week or so per map, about 3 hours per day. Then the map asset projects are a bit different, as I do this on my own schedule. I'll come up with a pack theme (such as pirates, medieval, isometric cities, etc) and make a list of assets and a rough count of each to include. I'll then draw the assets on Procreate, export them to my PC, organize and name the files, create product listing images and promos for them, then upload them to the appropriate markets.
"	"I only use AI tools in my asset pack creation, not commissions. If I'm having a hard time coming up with assets to fit in the pack I want to make, I'll ask AI tools such as Gemini or ChatGPT to help me brainstorm some ideas. Then, when I'm designing the assets, I will ask a generative AI program to bulk create the assets I want to include. I use these asset sketches as guidelines for doing the linework of my drawings. I don't use the actual files, but instead, I'll trace over the sketches using my style of art, making modifications as I draw. The rest of the process, including shading, coloring, details, etc is done without AI.
"	"I just recently started a pack of assets using an old inky style of art to fit antique fountain pen-drawn maps throughout history. I couldn't figure out the exact style I wanted, and couldn't replicate the images in my head onto Procreate, nor could I figure out the right shape for the mountains, so I used AI to generate about 30 jagged mountains using a blotchy ink shading so that I could see a tangible, visual representation of what was in my head so I could better replicate it with the Procreate brushes I have. It felt like cheating at first, to use AI to come up with a style that I don't have the skill to create on my own. But, I figured that I'm not stealing work, I'm not using the images themselves as the assets, and I'm only using the images as inspiration instead of the end product. So, it's okay, in my mind. I'm just using AI to fill the skill gaps I still have until I improve my craft enough to confidently fill those gaps on my own.
A lot of artwork on Etsy (a marketplace I sell on) is AI-generated, and I've seen people online criticize the use of AI for artwork in general. So, I felt super guilty at first, because I want to make ""real"" art, using my own ideas, designs, creativity, my own hand drawing the artwork. Then, I realized that I'm still doing all of that. I'm not generating artwork in 2 seconds just to turn around and sell that same image on Etsy for $3 as if I'm the artist. I admit that there is creativity in formulating prompts to give generative AI so that the end result is the best it can possibly be. But I don't want my brand and my business image to be so heavily tied to AI and the stigma that surrounds it. I don't want to be accused of stealing artwork, or stealing ideas and styles and designs. When I realized that my use of AI isn't making use of these unethical practices, I felt less guilty. Because I'm still using my ideas, my designs, my creativity, and my hand drawing the artwork. I'm just using AI as a tool to brainstorm some ideas and show me what proper perspective, proportions, and shadows look like on an asset. These are all things that I'm learning from the AI generations. When I realized that I'm not stealing anything, and that I'm not using AI in an unethical way (in my opinion), I felt okay with it. I don't see it as any different than following a ""how to draw mountains on your map"" guide from another creator. At least this way, I'm still staying true to my own style.

11	creativity_0011	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"Sounds good, I'm ready.
"	"I am a contract-based graphic designer who specializes in preparing projects to print. Typically, I produce a lot of promotional material for my clients, which includes some small projects like business cards or flyers, but also cohesive suites of materials (think business cards + forms, flyers, banners, etc.). I've even delved into website creation, script treatments, and more based on what clients need and what I can provide. A client will contact me, give me an idea of what they want, and generally give me free rein over how it gets made; then we hammer out changes.
"	"I'm in my thirties, so old enough to be wary of AI's current limitations, but also of the generation that understands that computers—and now, AI—are just another set of tools, just like Photoshop and Wacom tablets. There was pushback when these things became available to artists and designers, now people pay plenty for a good digital artist. In my case, I have used AI for my graphic design work sparingly, occasionally to make mockups of things that I want to produce with greater skill or specific sizing/layouts, but generally as a timesaver for rote tasks. For example, recently I asked if a client had a copy of his business logo, preferably on a business card, so I could take it and make it ""camera ready."" He had it on a shirt with a gray background. In Photoshop, this can be as easy as selecting a color range and knocking back the background or isolating the solid-color logo, but then you have to account for warp and any artifacts around the edges of it, which can be a pain to clean up. I used an AI tool  to extract this logo for me, and it did well, but wasn't perfect. It claimed to give me a transparent background, even threw in the gray-and-white checkerboard, but I still had to go in and separate the logo. Still, it saved some time; the edges were very clean and it took care of about 70% of the warping, so I killed the background and tweaked the warped text so I could use the logo.
"	"Another project I did was of a more personal nature. A colleague of my mother's had some photos from her niece's wedding that were, sadly, not terribly professional, but a relative did them for free. She remembered that I designed a banner for the store's manager who had died the previous year. There were no photos of the niece and her grandparents together, just in separate photos, and interestingly, there was a person in the main group photo to be edited that was wearing an oversized, neon orange shirt that completely overtook the bride. But the best photos of the grandparents had red eye and they weren't smiling. I was able to use AI to composite some ""good"" grandparents together, then in Photoshop I pasted everyone in, moved some people around in front of T-shirt guy (he was tall), toned down said shirt, then ran a copy of it through an AI tool to smooth some things out, then checked everything back over in PS to ensure it looked realistic, no floating hands, etc.

"	"One thing I will never use AI for is getting it to write or re-write a section of text for me as that's no better than employing a ghost writer and I'd feel a fraud. I will never lift an entire paragraph of text from AI and put it into my work. 
What I do use AI for is discussing some more technical aspects of writing. This might be as simple as the placement of a comma in a sentence, or as complex as shifting points of view between chapters of a novel. I might also use it for brainstorming ideas.
"	"Sure. I was grappling with POV in the early stages of my novel. I was writing in first-person POV but events were happening around the country (riots, looting, society breaking down). I was struggling with how I could describe those events in detail as the protagonist couldn't be at all these places around the country and I was wary of having an omniscient narrator.
It suggested various ways of describing second-hand accounts, e.g. news, social media, eye witness accounts, rumours, footage, etc. As it happened, my protagonist is a reporter which lends itself quite well to this. The person he's interviewing can be relating what he's seen in vivid detail to the protagonist - so I still get the ""show don't tell"" without the protagonist being there himself.
It did also suggest I gave it a section of my text for it to re-write in a more immersive way, but as already mentioned, that's not something I do.

"	"So I have a side job/hobby/hustle creating marketing materials for authors that they can use in promotions, like images or videos, all AI generated. My most recent project was to generate some clips with AI and then put those together to make a mini trailor or 'vibe reel' for a thriller novel set in rio de janeiro, so the author could use it as a banner on the books amazon page.
"	"So, the authors usually send me a 'storyboard' or general outline for what they want in the trailor, but I often use AI models to help me figure out more about the book if I have not read it, so for example I use ChatGPT or similar to break down the blub or a summary of the book, and use that to help me get the gist of the book. Then I can use this to turn into prompts for Sora to get the images.
"	"The author gave me a story outline for the trailor, 5-6 scenes or 'moments' he wanted short videos or images for - such as a scene walking through a favela, or standing on a hill above the city. He gave me the blurb and a summary, and also a folder full of reference images that could be useful for giving to Sora to animate or just to give me the idea of what he wanted. I then used each of these scenes to create a prompt to give to sora, and with a lot of tries and remixes came out with some good videos.

"	"So my creative niche is I create 3D printed tokens for card games, most typically Magic: The Gathering, using a program called HueForge to take a 2D design and give it depth, scale, and colour. A typical project is starting with a need for a token/card design - be it from client, or for general sales - and working through creating a drawing, photoshopping it to be set for HueForge, and then colour mapping in HueForge to create an STL, a 3D object, that is then ready to be 3D printed
"	"The main use for AI I have gleamed from my process is the ability to rapidly create 2D renderings/ideas for token genres. I will typically create a ""line"", like a series, of tokens that follow the same aesthetical style and I have created in Gemini a variety of system prompts, like one for generating prompts of aesthetical styles, and one for generating images from those prompts that meets the typical standards and aesthetics of a token that I need.

I most recently used AI to help in the research of my written work, specifically the history of spinsters, as the short stories I am writing are related to how women exist in the world independently from men and marriage. The AI was very helpful in pulling from several sources and finding unique perspectives that I might otherwise not have found on my own. It allowed me to focus more on the written aspect than the research.

"	"I am a board game designer. I am also a creative writer, focusing on poetry, short fiction, and personal narrative essays.
"	"For board game design, I use AI to help me create layouts for prototype components like cards, player boards, and shared boards. I also use AI to help create concept placeholder art for the prototyping and Playtesting stages of the design. For my creating writing, I use AI for proofreading and editing.
"	"Sure, I recently attended a board game design convention where participants played each other's games. I used AI to help create a placeholder cover for my game - something eye-catching that helped visually represent what the game was about and attract players to my table. This actually wound up taking quite a bit of time because the AI had difficulty with certain parameters like layering text on an image. This was frustrating and I wound up using AI to create the representative image while creating the text myself.

17	creativity_0017	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"Nope, go ahead.
"	"I write a lot in my own time and have finished a few (unpublished) books. I write mainly fantasy, but with a heavy focus on plot and character (often politics and intrigue), little to no magic and a preference for keeping things physically and logically plausible despite the plot occurring in a fictional world. This results in having to keep track of lots of practical details like the amount of time it takes to travel between places, probable weather conditions, the progression of moon phases, etc., as well as having to research topics I'm not familiar with to make sure I'm representing them with sufficient accuracy. I also run a Dungeons & Dragons homebrew campaign every couple of weeks, which involves a lot of worldbuilding and keeping track of characters and plot events my party has encountered.
"	"Generally for research purposes. Since I started using AI tools several months ago, I mainly use them for exploring topics I'm not familiar with. Often, an internet search for the kind of obscure questions I come up with requires multiple tweaks to get the search engine to understand what I'm going for and provide relevant links, then browsing multiple pages to get the answer I'm looking for.
In the past few months, a few of the things I've used AI tools to research are the Coriolis effect (working out the likely movement of storm systems off a particular coast), binary star systems (assessing the possibility and possible configurations of livable planets orbiting a star in such a system) and properties of iron vs. steel and the history of creating steel (determining whether a weapon bind in a fight could create sparks).
"	"The most recent was the sparking-weapons one. I asked generally about what kinds of metal create sparks when struck, then gave details about the specific weapon bind (a character crossing two shorter weapons, one made of silver, to block a downward swing from a big sword) and asked whether that kind of contact could create sparks if the two unspecified weapons were made of the right material. Then I asked for more information about the history of steelmaking to gauge whether the kind of high-carbon steel necessary to create sparks would be likely to exist commonly in that world, given where it is technologically (though I didn't provide any details about that). Finally I briefly asked whether the description I had written of the effect (""burst of sparks"") realistically captured the amount of sparks that might be created.
It didn't really influence what I wrote. If I had learned that it was unlikely sparks could be created by the weapons involved in the fight, I would have edited out the reference to sparks, but I essentially learned that I didn't need to change everything. At the end, I felt satisfied that what I had written was realistic.

"	"I'm a musician, I compose music and mix the audio. I use logic pro x as my DAW and things like native instruments plugins for the instruments. A typical project isn't always the same every time, but usually involves writing music for a game. If there is anything like a game ad/trailer video, then I usually treat that like scoring to picture.
"	"The 2 ai plugins I use are scaler and orb producer. Unfortunately there are no good ai plugins that I have found for use in the entire creation process, but I've found that these 2 are pretty good for brainstorming. Scaler is for chord progressions, and orb producer generates rough musical ideas that are good for building off of. I don't always use them in every project, but they are helpful for when writers block hits!
"	"I couldn't come up with a progression I liked myself, so I used scaler. It has presets the user can scale through, but can also suggest chords. Using the suggest feature in the sketch menu, I did end up finding something I liked after using it for a few minutes. I try not to rely on these features all the time so I don't get used to not having to do it myself, but it is nice to have the option when I need it.

"	"Well I'm a Graphic Designer, there are multiple different projects depending on the day. I've created many powerpoint templates for my job, worked on logos, and generally just try to keep the brand image consistent throughout different types of media.
"	"So typically I find myself asking for help when it comes to brainstorming. I'll have a general idea of what I want to do, but look to AI to see if there are any possible enhancements. I'll also sometimes find myself using it to sort of check my work. I'll feed it my ideas and see if there is anything I'm overlooking. Generally if I'm really stuck somewhere I might use it as inspiration to move forward in the project in a way I hadn't previously thought of.
"	"Yeah, as far as using it for brainstorming or a soundboard, I feel as though the work would come off as inauthentic if I used it for any of the actual design execution. It feels as there would be a sense of plagiarism and AI created art rather than human design. A recent project that comes to mind was dealing with the creation of a logo for a client. I had several mock up designs and wanted to figure out how to best match the brand identity. Asking Ai how switching certain color palettes might shift brand perception and creating a dialogue, asking it questions such as if a minimalist approach could have the same impact as serif-forward direction in the emotional aspects of the design. It felt like discussing the project with a well educated coworker.

"	"For the above illustration project, I had to produce a large suite of variations of a basic design. AI allowed me to easily and quickly iterate on my base illustration into a multitude of new versions. It worked well for this particular project.
I completed my base illustration by using a hand drawn image that was modified in Firefly, iterated on, then redrawn again by hand. Next, this finalised base illustration was turned into many aesthetic variations in Stable Diffusion
"
21	creativity_0021	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"No questions. I'm ready to begin.
"	"I'm a writer, primarily of science fiction and fantasy, so a project for me would be a book or a series of books, which can take months or years from start to finish. Rarely, I write a short story and that's more a matter of somewhere from hours to days, maybe weeks. But however big/long the project, they all go through similar phases of developing an idea; doing some pre-writing research, world-building, character development, initial plot development; the writing itself, which often includes revisiting earlier stages; an editing/revision/rewrite stage; and the final polish stage of editing. It's not a neat and tidy checklist of steps, but those are the general stages.
"	"I will sometimes use AI for research purposes, to help me get an overview of a topic and ideas on where I might need to do some deeper learning or give me ideas I might want to expand on, possibly point me toward resources where I can go and do more extensive research myself. I prefer not to rely on AI for research or learning, because it's still prone to inaccuracy and hallucination, but it's sometimes convenient for rounding up general information and giving me a starting point. And also just because I enjoy learning about things for myself, so I don't want to give up that part of the process. In the past, I'd do a Google search and check links and read general articles to get an overview point and then start doing the deeper research from there, so AI is essentially doing that initial Google search and general reading and compiling it for me.
"	"I'm not a scientist, but I enjoy writing sci fi, so learning the science that underpins some of the usual science fiction elements is part of the job. I had developed a planet with a specific set of characteristics that I needed for the purpose of the story, but it was not Earth-like, so I asked AI to help me determine things like weather and day/night cycles and what color the sky would be and, most importantly, what other things might be different which I hadn't even thought about. It provided me with a list of suggestions and, most importantly, reasons for those suggestions, so I was able to do deeper research into what it was telling me. It got a couple of details not quite right, but they were details I might not have thought to include at all otherwise.
"
22	creativity_0022	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"Sounds good to me. I'm ready to start.
"	"My creative work involves designing and leading workshops for businesses in many subject areas. As part of this work, I develop presentations, ebooks, training content and many other types of deliverables. These products always involve images, sometimes video, and require the use of graphic design elements. Sometimes this graphic design makes use of company logos, colours, and other in-house design elements but more often I have free reign to ensure the products I create best suite the type of workshop I design and facilitate. If I am doing a specific workshop, such as a design sprint, I am quickly capturing the work of the workshop attendees and using this to create products that represent the steps taken at various points in the workshop. To do this, I have to create documentation rapidly that is professional, visually appealing and can be used as part of the final deliverables I submit to the contracting company. I know that the more creative and visually appealing my content is the better it is received (with a professional focus of course!). I am often engaged in change initiatives, such as workplace culture, and create extensive interactive training files meant to engage staff in responsive learning. This means I focus my work on interactive learning scenarios rather than the read/watch videos and answer multiple choice questions that are so ineffective!
"	"I use AI in many different ways in my work. Sometimes if I feel ""stuck"" at the beginning of a project I will use an AI tool to brainstorm various approaches to a specific subject, moving from a general overall view to specific features, such as activities for workshop participants, content for digital files, suggested graphic features (colour, elements, layout), questions for company contacts, etc. I often use AI to create specific images I want to insert in my presentations and final deliverables. I use AI for video generation as well, although I often don't use these videos as they are not quite at the quality level I want. I find AI tools where I can generate non-realistic image based video (cartoon, line drawing, etc.) and off-screen narration most effective. I have successfully used AI augmented reality tools and that was lots of fun and very engaging for workshop participants. I also use AI to critique and edit my final documents, or to add design elements to almost finished products. I actually use AI tools a lot!
"	"A recent project where I used AI involved creating immersive learning for a nation wide veterinary company. Each veterinary location was owner managed but made use of company software, followed common procedural steps with business operations (including training) and worked to meet the business objectives of headquarters. I was asked to create training files that could be used at any location to train the various staff members commonly hired (front desk staff, lab techs, vet techs, vets, etc.) To do this I used AI software through a company called Thinglink. Using this AI software allowed me to take static images and information and make them interactive, including opportunities to use augmented reality. I absolutely loved the creative options I had through using Thinglink's AI and software platform. It made everything so much easier to create and share.
First of all, I didn't have to code anything which was excellent because I don't code at the level needed to produce interactive files. AI took care of that for me. It made the learning design process easier and quicker which kept me from getting bogged down in small details that were not central to the project (it kept me on track).  Another thing I liked was the help the AI tool gave with enduring content was accessible to many types of learners. In the past, I would need to access many different tools to create the content I was able to create using one AI driven tool. This saved me time which allowed me to focus more on producing engaging content rather than merging files and working with tools that don't always like to blend together.

We want a tagline that connects to customers, showcases our versatility and still be concise. I felt like different models have different abilities to generate a tagline. I was happy with the results and had a conversation to explore all possible options.

24	creativity_0024	Content writing	2	I work on writing research style blogs t	"Sounds good, I'm ready.
"	"I am a writer, a freelance author, editor, and indie publisher. I have written and published a couple of nonfiction books about fibromyalgia on Amazon, and done editing and assisted with publishing on about 5 other books written by other authors. A project I'm currently working on is a devotional intended for people with chronic pain, fibromyalgia, or other chronic illness, focused toward helping them figure out how they function according to God's will for their lives, and it's intended to be the first in a series of devotionals, each one with 40 days or entries, and each one also designed to encourage journaling, so each entry/day will include a journaling prompt at the end, and the print version will have a few pages of ruled paper for journaling after each devotional. I am working right now on the content of the first one, and once I have it finished, arranged, edited, etc, I will design the cover and publish it to Amazon and possibly other avenues, in digital and paperback versions. does that answer sufficiently?
"	"For my writing and publishing, I typically use AI quite a bit in the research phase, especially in searching out bible verses or passages that fit the material/subject matter, and especially finding verses that aren't as commonly used for what I'm writing about. For example, in my current book, Habakkuk is coming into play quite a bit. Then I will sometimes reach out to AI for help if I get stuck during my writing with what to say about something or how to express a particular idea. I tend, in my own words, to get too wordy sometimes, and sometimes I have trouble being direct or efficient in expressing an idea, so I'll use AI to get feedback or ideas on how I can say something. And then in the editing phase, I am an avid proofreader, but I will use AI to double check my work and get final feedback. Also to find things that might not be super obvious, like an extra space where it doesn't belong. I have not previously used it for cover design, but I might end up incorporating some of that going forward.
"	"I haven't had other major projects, because I've been working on the current one off and on for awhile , and have recently dealt with a lot of illness. But I can tell you that kind of a sub-portion of the current project where AI was quite useful was when I needed to figure out how to organize my devotionals for the book. I had all of these devotionals which I had written individually but didn't want to just put them in a random order, or something kind of arbitrary like alphabetical, and I didn't necessarily want to go in biblical order by the passage I used for each one, but something that would be meaningful for the readers. So through discussions with a couple of models I was able to decide on 8 categories, with each one having 4 smaller devotionals, and 1 that was more comprehensive, so that it was essentially 8 sets of 5 devotionals, with each covering an area like accepting your illness or God's path, understanding why God allows illness in His followers and how He uses it, and ways that we can still serve and God can still use us, despite, or even because of, our challenges. That help in coming up with the 8 subdivisions, and especially in organizing the devotionals into categories, was incredibly helpful. I felt overwhelmed going in, but by the end I was very grateful for this new tool.

"	"I don't use AI too often because I really enjoy my creative process, but it as been really helpful for some tasks. I will use it to edit things that I've written or help find a suitable color palette for a painting idea I have. If I get stuck on a macrame knot or crochet stitch it has helped me quicker than searching myself does.
"	"Actually, this is really cool. I saw an image on the internet a couple weeks ago and it instantly inspired me to want to paint something. I uploaded the image to AI and explained my idea for the painting and asked the AI to pull out the colors from the image that I would need and tell me the names. That was very helpful because I didn't have to go through the tedious task of mixing colors and doing a sample sheet to find the perfect shades.

26	creativity_0026	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"Sounds good. Go ahead.
"	"I work as a screenwriter for film and television. ""Typical"" varies quite a lot in my line of work. The circumstances around one project are never quite the same. However, you could probably categorise it into three buckets: original writing, rewriting, writing for hire. If I'm doing original writing, I will come up with an idea for a story, determine whether it's best suited to TV or film, then start to ideate on story, characters etc, until I have a sense of the overall plot of the feature or pilot/first season of the TV show. I'll then most likely write it on spec and have my agent send it out, rather than try pitching it out. For rewriting (usually film), I will digest the materials that need work, dissect flaws and strengths, how they can be improved, whether I am the right person to do so, and will then pitch my take on what/how to improve the project to the filmmakers involved. If I get the job, I will then try and execute this take, enhancing the script as a whole along the way, in addition to the specifics in my pitch. Usually, there will be at least one revision step where I can adjust/course-correct/inject further feedback from the filmmakers. In terms of writing for hire, I will be interviewed by show-runners, filmmakers etc. based on the strength of my previous work and then be invited to make suggestions or pitch my take on underlying material or ideas. My job will be to serve whoever is in charge of the creative vision, enabling their intentions and, if given the job, helping to execute this vision.
"	"Usually during my own original writing, particularly at an early ideas stage when outlining, I might use AI to say, ""Give me ten surnames for a man from Barnsbury born in 1971"". Usually, I will not get the ideal response from asking that question, but it will send me on a path towards what I actually want by giving some examples and eliminating what I don't want.
Correct. I have found it most useful as a starting point in my own work, it saves me time from searching for inspiration on a broader canvas and instead delivers more quickly the sort of thing I'm looking for. Sometimes its easier to determine what you don't want than knowing exactly what you do; i.e. you probably have a ball-park idea of what you're looking for, but might not be able to articulate it exactly, a sort of ""know it when I see it"" creative aspect.
"	"I used it for generating character surnames in a feature film I wrote. I also used it as a way of iterating idioms, which where part of a joke in a character's dialogue - the dialogue wasn't sounding quite right, or quite as funny as what I was reaching for. Again, the AI didn't give me something better, but by combining and refining its suggestions I was able to reach something I was happy with.
The back and forth was pretty limited. I asked for iterations based on ""bull in a china shop"", which it listed. I was then able to hone in on ""loose cannon"" asking for more like that. I then asked it to generate examples a few more times before settling on which of the examples I thought was closest to my intention.

"	"So my main business I have that involves creative work is using a Cricut machine to vinyl items such as T-shirts & clothing and also vases, wine bottles, glasses, mugs etc as gifts. I can pretty much vinyl most things including photos.  A typical project to me could be designing a logo for a T-shirt, cutting this into vinyl and then applying it with heat.
"	"Oh it does, it can be so time consuming depending on the design. I have to use a special tool to weed out the vinyl before transferring it. Imagine at Christmas when you have loads to prepare.
I certainly do! I literally get mental block when trying to think of ideas so I use AI to generate these ideas for me, usually Gemini. Gemini will give me design ideas to generate in Cricut and also gift ideas involving vinyl.
"	"Now let me think, I work on so many projects I don't know whether I am coming or going most days!!  The most recent project I can think of was a friend wanted me to make a unique, memoriable gift for their mum who was turning 90 years old. I didn't want it to be the usual cushion or vase so I asked Gemini to provide me with a list of gift ideas to make. The ideas that Gemini came out with I never would have dreamt of in my wildest dreams, they were so thoughtful and out of the box.
To be honest it was a relief and like a weight had lifted off of me. I didn't want to let me friend or her mum down with a rubbish gift idea which would look bad on me but I just could not think of anything. I also had so much going on that, honestly, I just didn't have the time to think either. Gemini saved me time. I felt happy and satisfied if that's how you can describe it I guess. Also optimistic, knowing there was this ability to generate insane ideas to make my business amazing.

"	"So I am an author, to date I have published two novels, both thriller novels with philosophical themes. I am currently writing a fantasy series.
"	"I find that AI is a terrific way of becoming ""unstuck"". If I can give you an example, I required a way of describing an institution somewhat like a bank in a pre-industrial society. The list of suggestions given (I always ask for 10 plus suggestions) essentially rebooted my semantic field and I came up with the perfect description for what I wanted , triggered by the best suggestions. I use AI in this way both with descriptions for concepts (novel or adapted), or sometimes just word choices.
"	"So I've recently been writing a new series called [REDACTED], with the first novel being called [REDACTED]. In addition to using it on a number of occasions as the catalyst as you say for word choices and conception descriptions, I also use it to talk though world-building consequences. For example, the word has two moons, I described their cycles to the model, and used it to determine the frequency of sacred nights on which both moons were full.

"	"You bet. I design and hand-paint custom shoes for people. A typical project includes planning the shoe design digitally, which is usually what takes longest. Once I have the thumbs up from the customer, I sketch the design onto the shoe. I then use paints and brushes to paint the design onto the shoe, using a matte protectant to seal and protect the design when finished.
"	"I reach to AI quite frequently throughout the process. Sometimes I use it to help me write emails if I am feeling overwhelmed or nervous about certain customers. I use it to help me come up with ideas for what to put where on my shoe designs. I also use it to discuss color combinations and how they would look on certain parts of the shoe. If I'm facing serious artist's block, I'll have it make some designs for me to gain inspiration from. I NEVER copy these designs - they are used strictly to inspire unique ideas for myself. I also ask it for recommendations on different types of paints and sealer, if I'm wanting to switch my materials up a bit.
"	"[REDACTED] Yeah! I recently did a commissioned pair of Attack on Titan shoes. When I started out, I wasn't really sure how I wanted to represent the characters on the shoes. Positioning is super important; the shape of the shoe can really distort characters, if they're not placed right. To help me, I had the model make a few different shoe layouts for me, each with the characters facing certain directions. I was able to find a position that fit very nicely on the shoe. I also had it help me figure out which color would be best for the background. It was incredibly helpful to have the support - it made the project run so much smoother, which was really needed at the time. I was lined up with 11 different commissions, so it made all the difference. I'll attach a picture of how the shoes turned out! The picture honestly makes them look a little weird, but I promise they look pretty perfect in person, haha.

"	"I'm a writer! I'm in the process of working on my debut novel right now, so I'm deep in the trenches of writing and editing my manuscript. Therefore, I have to come up with things like a title, characters, plot, etc.
"	"I don't allow myself to use AI for the creative meat and potatoes of my story, because I want it to be authentic to me. However, I do find myself looking for help for titles in my work by giving AI a synopsis of my story. I also tend to go to it to come up with names that sound good for siblings, last name ideas, things like that which aren't as crucial to the creative part of my work.
"	"I was really struggling with a title for my book. I had everything else, my story was well rounded, but nothing was sticking out within my work that would make the perfect, catchy title. I used AI to brainstorm, which then got my creative juices flowing, and I bounced back and forth with it until we found a perfect title.
So, I started by basically saying, ""here's the plot of my story, here's something significant that happens in it, here are the main characters' namds
Sorry, hit send on accident! Let me start over. So, I started by basically saying, ""here's the plot of my story, here's something significant that happens in it, here are the main characters' names, can you help?"" AI then gave me some ideas, none of which sounded right. However, they did point out something minor from my story I mentioned, which gave me an idea. It was a play on a classic phrase that most people would probably know, but not all. I asked for advice on if it was clear what I was playing off of, and if AI thought people would get it. AI said they likely would, and gave me some similar ideas. One of the ideas it gave was almost perfect, so I changed one word and got a title I love.

31	creativity_0031	Audiovisual	4	I'm a musician, so my projects range fro	"No, I am ready to begin.
"	"I am a video producer. I don't have very ""typical"" projects. Right now I am working on a video for a hypnotist and a short animated film about God and His many forms. Earlier this year, I shot an  independent feature film about 4 Generations of black women with sleep disorders and psychic powers. In the past, I was mostly focused on making television and podcasts about technology.
"	"It completely depends on the project - the videos for the hypnotist mix short shots of AI-generated images and video in with traditional graphics and editing. The short about God is all AI-generated video edited together with traditional non-linear editing. The feature film did not use AI, but I am going back now to see it I can stitch together some stills we shot with footage we took by using AI, without it looking like I'm using AI.
The first two projects I mentioned are animated, so it is either easy to blend the AI-generated animation in with the rest of the video, or, in the case if the religious piece, it all looks AI generated, which is fine. But the feature film is all real people, in real environments, so  anything AI-generated has to look real - characters have to be consistent, people can't have 6 fingers, etc.
"	"Right now, I  am trying to make transitions from some photos we took that I photoshopped to look like they are old black and white pictures to color footage of the same moment. Unfortunately, the photos and footage don't line up perfectly, and one is a different shot entirely, so trying to get a smooth transition has been very interesting, but also frustrating. I haven't gotten a result I like yet.

32	creativity_0032	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"Sounds good. Let's start with your first question.
"	"I write short fiction stories. The genre varies; Sci-Fi and Fantasy are favorites of mine, but I write in other genres too. It starts with brainstorming, and when I find an interesting idea or concept to try I start researching the topics that might be relevant. I plan an overall arc for the story to follow with some specific events or scenes to keep my later drafts organized. I typically make edits on the fly, but usually make several edits/refinements throughout the process. Once I think I'm happy with how the project is turning out I'll usually take some time away from it before returning to see if I'm still happy with it. Afterwards I upload the story to an appropriate public site if I'm just writing it for fun, or send it to the person who commissioned it in that case.
"	"I do try to limit my use of AI, so it's my voice and writing style and not someone else's. Sometimes I use AI while editing, to make sure what I've written makes sense and flows in a coherent manner, as well as double-check my grammar and spelling. I also sometimes use it for brainstorming, a change in perspective can really help to come up with interesting ideas. I prefer to do my own research for now, however, sometimes Google's AI Overview has links to pages that are useful, but I usually disregard the actual content of that overview and just check the cited webpages instead.
"	"I recently was writing in Microsoft Word, which has integrated AI. It automatically highlights what has been written and prepares suggestions. In the case of grammar or spelling mistakes it is very useful, but sometimes it prepares suggestions that go beyond that. In this particular case it suggested I change some words to make the sentence easier to read when I had written it to emphasize a specific word in that sentence. The suggestion was technically right, it would be easier to read if I followed its advice, but it would have also defeated the whole point of writing the sentence to begin with. I didn't want to see anymore AI suggestions for the rest of the day because I kept thinking that if everyone used these kinds of suggestions to ""improve"" their writing, everyone's style would be the same. No one would have a unique writing style anymore. I suppose the experience made me feel conflicted. AI can be very useful for small corrections, but when it is forced into software it's invasive, encouraging over-reliance on the model's functions.

"	"I do quite a lot of creative work with AI. I do many crafting projects, design social media posts, peruse AI for inspiration for crochet projects and patterns, come up with fun ideas to boost morale at my place of work, etc. Recently, I used AI to design a bubble gum machine logo for my office. It gives out adult prizes. AI helped me come up with a vinyl design that reads: [REDACTED]'s Subpar Prize Machine: Lower your expectations and turn the knob. It has a melty smiley face on it. The staff members love it! I also have used AI recently to come up with many social media posts and inspiration for the dental office I work at.
"	"I ultimately begin with AI to expand on an idea that I have. Let's talk about the bubble gum machine to start. I first saw an old bubble gum machine for sale and thought it would be awesome for staff members to be able to earn tokens to get a spin. When I got my initial idea, I then turned to AI to first get recommendations on fun trinkets to put in that were fun and adult humor. Then I asked it to generate some fun names to call it based on some factors: my office is in the basement, it hands out subpar gifts, it is my own personal machine and not sanctioned by the doctors, etc. After inputting my initial ideas, I was able to conversate back and forth until I settled on the perfect name. After settling on a name, I continued to consult it to come up with a fun slogan so staff members would know not to expect anything super great from the machine, as it is truly just a fun little game to boost morale. After I decided on a fun slogan, I was able to consult it to come up with a design for a vinyl cut out to put on the front of the machine.
"	"I initially stated what I was doing with the project and gave the details I mentioned to you earlier. AI then gave some suggestions and I went back and forth multiple times, over multiple days even, to finally come up with a name I thought was perfect. AI suggested many names to begin with and I would prompt back stating to focus more on one thought process (ex: add more suggestions that have to do with my office being in the basement, give me more suggestions that get the point across that these prizes are basically worthless, give me a suggestion that uses my name, make it shorter because it needs to fit on a 5"" x 17"" glass front and I want the words readable, etc.). After spending quite a few turns (probably 10 over a few days), the model suggested a name I thought embodied the project very well--[REDACTED]'s Subpar Prize Machine. I then wanted to add a little subtext so went back to the model to gain ideas for wording. Again, I needed it to be a short length so it would fit well on the space I needed. After the same back and forth process I mentioned above, I settled on Lower your expectations and turn the knob. I run the ideas by a few friends and they all agreed it was a great name.

"	"I'm a science fiction novelist. Most of my series have involved time travel, but the current one is a bit of a departure. It's a four-book series set in the late 21st century, and partially takes place on a Mars that is in the final stages of terraforming. My academic background is more historical and political than scientific, so I frequently have biology questions, and sometimes need to know things like how far it is from one geographic point on Mars to another.
"	"Any time I have a question that requires me to use advanced math. :)  I've also used AI to help come up with some basic rules for a language. Occasionally, I use AI as an advanced thesaurus when I can't come up with the right word.  Or when I need to figure out how much a knish might cost at a food truck in 2090 given typical rates of inflation. Stuff like that.
"	"I needed to figure out whether the process of growing lab meat and the quality of the final product would be affected by the lower gravity on Mars.
I simply asked what the differences might be and was then given a list of changes. One of my beta readers is a biologist, and I usually run these things past her, but she was away from the computer. When I spoke with her later, she said that the response was well-reasoned and lower gravity would probably have many of those effects. I like being able to get a general idea on topics like this before I run them past beta readers and other specialists I know, because it saves them time I have my ducks in a row before I contact them. I was less happy with some of the creative suggests for a generic name for lab meat, but I can usually come up with those on my own.

"	"I do visual arts in a variety of mediums. An example project may be an acrylic painting, that I may than scan to make prints out of.
"	"I like using AI to brainstorm and when I am stuck. I might use it to help generate a list of ideas when I have a creative block, or to help expand an idea. For instance, if I know I want to paint something using paynes grey with a red accent that has an autumn theme, I might ask AI for a list of possible subject matter or ideas for paintings.
"	"An example of when I used AI was when I wanted to paint a series of woodland themed small paintings. I planned to paint a mushroom in one, a fern in another, and then I asked AI for a list of other ideas to help me come up with other subjects to expand the series on theme. It helped me decide to also paint a fallen tree and wild berries.

"	"AI is useful for when I'm trying to craft pitches to prospective clients, respond to client emails, or when I want to know what a contract or TOS says.
I don't use Generative AI in my creative work. If I'm feeling really stuck and uninspired, I might use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. But ultimately, I try to avoid AI use in my workflow as I don't want to become dependent on it. Creativity is a muscle and if I don't exercise it, it will wither!
"	"I've been wanting to branch out and create stock patterns and graphics to sell online. I generally design in my own aesthetic/style,  but I know that I'd sell more graphics if I created them in a larger range of styles and appeal to more niches. So I asked for a list of styles and niches. I probably could have done my own research, but it was way faster to just get the list using AI. Once I got the list, I picked a few niches that seemed promising.
I mean, it was definitely a timesaver and time is money. That said, using AI as an assist, rather than letting it do the actual core, creative work, allows me to maintain my integrity as a creative.

37	creativity_0037	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"Sounds good.
"	"I have two types of creative work. The first is creating images for adult coloring pages. They are more intricate than a child's coloring page with more detail. For instance, a realistic dragon sleeping in a forest surrounded by trees, fairies, crystals, and hidden images amongst the leaves. So, a project would be taking a creative scene in my head and turning it into an image of black and white lines with no shading. The second is writing creative passages for use in social media. They are short passages but very specific in their theme and tone. A project would entail focusing in on a message that I want to convey and wording it most efficiently without losing the tone. I then might put that message to music and imagery to create a ""reel.""
"	"I have more creativity in my mind than in my hand so AI helps me in that regard. AI is very helpful for creating coloring pages. I have the scenes in my head but I do not have the talent to put that scene onto paper. As far as creative writing, sometimes I have a message that flows but sometimes I can't seem to get it across eloquently. AI's creative writing is fantastic. It can help me put my thoughts to paper, or reword more eloquently, or shorten a passage for social media.
"	"For coloring pages, I recently requested the dragon sleeping in the forest as well as a few other images, like a sitting Buddha and a fairy in flight. I allowed some creative freedom for the AI when I requested the images such as 'surrounded by trees and crystals and other magical objects' and I built off of what AI offered in the image. It felt fun at times and frustrating at times if the AI did not understand the feedback. For creative writing, I recently asked for a short passage (although longer than a social media reel) with a very particular tone of invoking the dragons out of dormancy to activate the Earth's ley lines (darn it I can't find it right now) and I needed help creating an eloquent passage. I was floored by the results. It was so on point with my intention.
The request is always for a black and white line image. The image I received had some partial shading in it. I requested the AI remove the shading but it just could not seem to do it. It seems that sometimes when an image is already created, the AI has difficulty editing the image. It might even elicit more errors outside of what you requested. Sometimes it's easier to just start over but that can be frustrating when you had a great image but then the AI makes a new creation that is missing parts you liked from the first one. Admittedly, I would probably be getting better results with AI that is more specialized in image creation and/or higher level paid subscriptions. I am still playing around with all different AIs for image creation.

"	"I have reached for them to brainstorm ideas for certain projects or to help create catchy headings if my creative juices aren't flowing. A couple of times, if I've been particularly short on time, I've used them to create first drafts that I've then gone in to edit (usually quite heavily). I use AI more as a collaborator. I don't like to hand over the reins entirely!
"	"I was tasked with writing some financial content for a website recently, which isn't something I'm particularly clued up on. I asked some LLMs to explain the concepts to me in a simplified manner so that I had a clearer idea before I started writing. I found this really helpful and insightful. I did do some online research, too, but the amount of information felt overwhelming, so it was nice to get some clarity.

"	"When I am looking for ways to grow my social media following, engagement and reach, I have asked AI what the best practices are. I have also asked for inspiration about types of content bundles I can offer, as well as descriptions for workshops.
"	"I recently used AI to help me think of content bundle ideas. I found it actually very helpful and was impressed by the ideas. I took inspiration from 3 of the ideas it came up with and adapted them into my own offering. It was nice to have the inspiration, but I admit I feel hesitant when using AI for creative ideas.
I don't want to form a habit of relying on AI for my creative ideas. I want them to come from my own creative thought process.
I took the general idea of each, for example, one bundle idea was about doing art with the changing seasons, and I took another idea I had previously and combined it with the AI one. It became ""Syncing with the Seasons"" taking an idea I had about syncing your natural rhythms to your art practice. It was just the right amount of inspiration I needed to make another idea I had make sense

"	"I'm primarily a writer and I'm currently in the preliminary phase of writing my first novel. This phase of writing involves research into the philosophical and historical grounding of the story. This involves an enormous amount of archival research and reading in philosophy and history,  and a little bit of writing.
"	"I use AI to do a particular kind of brainstorming-- the AI is my philosophical interlocutor. My writing process involves thinking through concepts that I've read from philosophy, history and literary criticism. I use the AI to discuss these concepts and refine my thoughts. Sometimes the AI can help explain difficult concepts to me or correct the errors of my thinking. The purpose of tarrying with philosophy is to help ground refine the story's philosophical and historical implications. The AI can also recommend books on a particular subject. For example, if I want a history book on Canada written from the Marxist perspective, the AI can provide a list of titles for me. If I need help with a concept like Walter Benjamin's concept of the ""dialectical image"", a brief conversation with the AI can clarify how this concept would work in fiction.
"	"My novel is set in Southern Ontario in the 2010s, a period when thousands of Ontarian's lost their jobs to factory closings. The main character, a history graduate with a bachelor's degree finds himself unemployed, and musing about the founding of the Canadian Confederation. I wanted to frame a passage in the novel like a montage of dialectical images that flash between the founding of the Confederation. I engage the AI in a conversation about Walter Benjamin's paper on the philosophy of history which I used to clarify Benjamin's terminology and his philosophy of history more broadly. I then asked for some Marxist history books on the founding of Canada and it recommended ""Rebels Reds, Radicals: Rethinking Canada's Left History"" by Ian McKay. The conversation felt quite stimulating and led to some productive writing sessions for me. I keep the same conversation channel with the AI open and revisit it daily, discussing different philosophers and historical events.

"	"I was recently asked to pitch a song for a client with a sizeable repertoire that includes many different ""eras"" of themselves. While trying to capture the energy and feeling of a specific time in their career, I asked an LLM to analyze the lyrics of a few popular songs from this artist's reference period to find a common link or meaning. In this instance, the LLM was able to capture the underlying vibe of the era and provide some suggestions of themes for me to lead off the lyrics with. Although I had already written the majority of the music, the suggestions lead me to view the piece in a different light and make some changes that I would not have made otherwise. The client loved one moment in particular that was heavily influenced by one of the creative tangents that was inspired by the original LLM conversation.

"	"My typical creative work is editing real estate photos and videos, every now and then I might have to do some ""people"" photography and events, but mainly Real Estate.

A typical projects involves going out in person to the property to capture whatever the client inquired about, and then back in my office, editing the media to make it MLS ready. If a video was purchased, then I would have to sift through the video clips to find the best ones, put them in Premiere Pro, set the sequence based on the natural flow of the property, and then combine it with background music (cutting clips to a downbeat), and making any minor color correcting edits
"	"More specifically with photo editing, I find myself using AI tools to remove unwanted objects out of the image, adding in wanted objects, and sometimes asking AI on how to do a new things with editing if it ever comes up that I need to do something new. For example, a while back, I had to learn how to brighten up certain parts of an image to give it a ""twilight"" effect, I needed the help of AI to learn how to do so without having to go through multiple YouTube videos.

I also use it ""uncreatively"" in that I have AI help me make email campaigns to reach out to possible clients to help me with my pipeline of clientele. Making up emails to send out cold emails is not fun, so using AI allows me to have more time to actually interact with the people I currently work with and learning new things for my job.
"	"The most recent project that I used AI to help me with was editing out people and vehicle out of an image. Before, doing something like that would have taken an immense amount of time just to remove it, and then you have to worry about replacing it with something to match the background and doing that would just not look seamless because of different lighting and other factors. AI has helped with that process in that it removes, AND adds in background based on the surrounding image and it looks seamless. I use AI through Adobe Lightroom to do so

I have recently stated using AI to help me brainstorm title ideas and help create a base draft for my blurbs and loglines.
"	"I'm currently drafting a novel and have used it to help brainstorm plot ideas when I got stuck in the middle of the draft. I didn't use most of the ideas it came up with, but the ""wrong"" ideas sparked the right ones. I recently used AI after drafting the novel to come up with a blurb and title ideas. It was the same kind of situation where I didn't use the ideas exactly, but it served as a launch pad for my own ideas. Using AI for that part really helped save me a lot of time.

Other copywriting I do includes neighborhood newsletters and editing content for websites. Most of my work involves some level of SEO as well.
"	"Typically, I'll take the client's brief and generate one or both of a detailed outline for the project and/or ask for well-researched citations into interesting facts and statistics about the topic.
It depends on the level of research needed for the project. On the 'low' end, I'll just ask a search-enabled smart AI (like GPT-5 thinking or Opus 4.1 or Gemini 2.5 Pro) to provide me with some interesting facts and statistics from specifically .edu, .gov, or .org sources (or pdfs) to avoid linking competitive articles. If its a big project I need to know lot of new information for, I like to use deep research - typically OpenAI or Grok's, but also Gemini or Perplexity if I'm not finding what I want. These reports I tend to read more or less fully (at least the interesting parts) and sometimes read the sources too. I then tend to copy-paste a bunch of the more interesting claims into a detailed outline and ask another (usually different AI) to fact check everything I might use for the article.
"	"One larger project I had was actually writing a report on Solar Energy expansion in the Middle East for a Qatar Solar Company. For this, not only did I use multiple deep research reports, but I also used ChatGPT's ability to make charts to help visualize the data. I did find that o3 (the model I was working with at the time) still struggled with extracting data from a visual chart - like if I uploaded a graph or chart to it, it couldn't read it accurately. This meant I still had to spend a lot of time verifying that it had the correct data for the many charts in the report. In terms of writing help, I tend to prefer 3rd party editing tools (like Grammarly) to strictly asking an AI to help with editing, as it does tend to go overboard.

"	"I am writer, predominantly of literary fiction. I have written one novel and am in the process of researching another. I like complex books which usually have historical and/or philosophical elements.
"	"With my first novel I spent nearly a year doing preparatory research. At that time I was studying for a PhD in History and was able to freely access online journals and research portals via the university. I'm no longer a student, so I don't have access to those resources now as many are only available to institutions.  I have used AI to help with researching the second novel as it is set in Canada at the start of the second World War. I find using AI very efficient, although I am conscious of the fact that it isn't always truthful.
To work around the truthful issue, I double check anything I'm doubtful about. It's time consuming, but not as time consuming as doing the research myself. I am using my grandmother's letters to my grandfather as the basis of the novel. She left the UK and took her two children to Canada at the onset of the war and stayed until the end of it. I have never visited the particular area before and can see on Google Maps how much it has changed in the intervening years. I have used AI to help me build a clearer picture of life in that area in the 1940s, I have also asked it to elaborate on details my grandmother touches on in her letters about the war and also I have asked questions about a white person such as myself writing a book that features First Nation mythology, as I am concerned about getting the approach wrong.
"	"I wanted to open the novel with a myth about 'Raven', who was supposedly born on the shores of the area where my novel is set. I asked the model if this would be problematic, but I remember thinking that its answer was too woolly to be helpful. It hedged its bets! I decided in the end not to use it.

"	"One of the projects that I work on the most is basically the creative part of the process for selecting and preparing an episode for my history podcast, which falls more specifically into the realm of ASMR History for sleep. I choose a story or two related stories form either a specific event in history or a couple of related history topics and then tell a story for about 45 minutes or so.  I use AI to help me brainstorm ideas for my next ""episode,"" help me complete outlines for the research, find sources for my actual research, and write a script that I will then use to record the episode.  For instnace, I was having trouble picking a topic a few weeks ago and with the help of a model that asked several questions, we settled on the story of the ""Fall of Constantinople"" and then created an outline.  The episode should be out in 2 weeks, so I am working on research now and will return with a tentative script that a model will help me ""clean up,"" or edit for recording.
"	"At the beginning of the process, not every time, but often, for brainstorming the topic.  Then a quick, rough ""outline"" to help kickstart the research.  Then I return just before recording usually, or if I'm having trouble with sources I might ask for help in the middle of research.  But then I return to see if there is any advice the model might give me on ""cleaning up"" the script to make it flow more like a seamless story.
It really comes down to how creative I am feeling in the moment, or sometimes how my week has gone.  As a person attending grad school for history, sometimes there is a topic brought up in my classes that really captures my attention and I devote an episode to that.  Sometimes I have ""writer's block"" and need a little help, which is when I turn to the model for inspiration.
"	"Yes, to go back to the ""Fall of Constantinople"" project, it was during the summer. I was not in class, I had not done much reading that week, and felt a little burnt out.  I had a conversation with an AI model that I had used enough in the past that it knew which eras of history I generally showed more interest in, and asked for a brainstorming session.  The model did a decent job of shouldering some of the burden of the conversation and eventually suggested a story on Mehmet I, who was the ruler that overthrew Constantinople in 1453, which sparked my interest to do that story on that. There are plenty of secondary sources on that topic, so I did not really need help with the research, but my notes were actually a little too detailed and the story was going to be very long.  So I returned and asked the model to trim approximately 10 minutes worth of time. It did fairly well at keeping the key points in and removing some extraneous chatter.  It helped ease some of the stress I was feeling to produce an episode as well as remove points, which I loathe, because I've usually worked pretty hard to come up with the script.  So it helps me out to have AI remove some content for me, because it can be difficult for me to choose.

47	creativity_0047	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"No, you can proceed with the questions.
"	"Sure! I'm a writer and my preferred genre is literary fiction. I write novels, novellas, short stories, and poetry. I'm a hybrid sort of writer, I plan things ahead, visualise scenes in my head before putting them to paper. It helps be get the work done faster and boots my confidence. I always want to have the emotional beats down and then I always leave room for updates as I go. So it's mixture of planning and discovery writing.
"	"Mainly during the brainstorming stage. My pride as a writer and my personal ethics don't allow me to use AI to create content instead of my own brain and imagination, but I do use it as a feedback tool and a beta reader. For instance, I test the sound of character names, I ask for information on etymology, what would a good name that means XYZ would be, how can I use a substitute for a name that exists in real life, e.g., a country by alluding to its cultural specifics. Basically, it acts as a search engine/feedback tool.
"	"I was working on an entirely new project, which occured to me, making my own manga plot. I had. a long chat with an AI assistant trying out various character names, which I wanted to connect to particular character concepts, e.g., alluding to darkness, vengenance, light, hope, etc. I repeatedly asked it to summarise the plot thus far as it was evolving, which made it easier to keep track of my thoughts.
"
48	creativity_0048	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"Sure. No questions.
"	"I am writing a novel and I've also written smaller novels and non-fiction books and training materials. But I probably use it most frequently for my novel lately.
"	"I've used it to begin research into things I have limited experience with. For example, I have characters who are FBI agents and ones who work in the funeral business, so I've done a lot of asking questions about what kinds of things would be realistic in those settings and those roles. For example, I'll write a scene and then put it into an LLM and ask if it seems plausible, or if I'm being too Hollywood-educated about it, and what the terms for certain things are. Another thing I use it for is looking for terms for things it would take longer for me to look up. Like when one of my characters decides he doesn't want the monuments business his father wills him, I had to look up the legal papers that would be used for that process. (A disclaimer, apparently.)  
Also, I've used it to put in segments of my book and ask what other parts of the scene i may have overlooked, or trivia that help with the verisimilitude of the story.  
On smaller projects, I've also given the model a general idea of the setting, character, tone of the story, certain happenings that had to happen, and then I ask it to write what basically amounts to a trellis that I can build the actual story around. It helps me with pacing and not getting bogged down in the details of the first chapter instead of moving all the way though the plot. 
I probably use it for more, but that's what is coming to mind right now.  
Oh, and character names or business names sometimes - though I often end up getting inspiration and not final options from the model.
"	"Yes, one of the things I used it for was that I have a character whose parents perished using medical euthanasia. I had to ask where they could go to have it done, how their bodies would have been returned to the states (since I sent them to Switzerland) and what diseases they would both have had to justify wanting to pass in a dignified way instead of waiting it out. (He had advanced ALS and she had Pancreatic Cancer, and neither wanted to become a long-term burden to their children. Being as they worked in the funeral industry, they appreciated the sense of being in control of their final moments and not putting their family through the chaos that so many other families went through when death came on its own.) I had to make sure they were diseases that would reasonably have them of sound mind when they made the choice to depart, and that I handled it with some sensitivity because it can be a tender subject for a lot of people.
It felt very helpful to be able to have a relevant conversation about what was going on with my characters and that guide the information I was being provided instead of having to do research for each keyword piece by piece.

"	"I reach out to an LLM in particular during a few phases. Brainstorming is the most successful exchange, generally speaking, because we can bounce back and forth on ideas, worldbuilding, sound choices, etc. I occasionally ask for help with soft-synth sound design or composition, but LLMs rarely deliver on that. Troubleshooting is, again, an area where they tend to struggle - since they don't know more than I could've already found online.
I've also used AI Music tools for ideas here and there, but I try not to use them too often.
My descriptions are generally fragmented and abstract, and they tend to coalesce and ground these into something more centralized and simplified.

Veo 3 has just been the best since its release, so I generally use that model. So, for example, a funny ai clip can better emphasize a point in the video, or tie together two clips that aren't directly related. 
Generally I'll think about the type of video I need to improve my content and just start prompting and making tweaks until I get what I need. Sometimes the voice doesn't match up perfectly and I'll voice over it myself or use elevenlabs.
I've also generated effects on a green or black screen and used those in my videos
"	"Yeah I recently mentioned the streamer, Asmongold, in a video and wanted something funny to go along with it. So I created an exaggerated cartoon style video of a balding man streaming out of a ridiculously dirty room with roaches crawling all over his garbage.

"	"I'm a short film screenwriter. So I typically work on screenplays that are about 15-20 pages. I write drama, romance, thrillers. There is one project I was working on that's significantly longer though. A feature film but that's more of a passion project than anything.
"	"I mostly use AI for feedback and sometimes continuing when I have writer's block. So, typically I will have started a scene or started with an idea and I go to AI to bounce off what direction I'd like to take it. If I get a scene written by AI, I'll take that framework and re-work it to fit my voice and style.
"	"Yeah, I was working on a drama/ romance kind of script. So first I described each of the characters personalities to the model and asked for name ideas. That was really great because the name to me is pretty important, it tells the audience a little before they know anything, in my opinion at least. It's human nature to judge a book by it's cover. The model did a great job with the names. Later, I gave the model the general idea of the story and asked if it thought I needed comic relief within a pretty serious script. We discussed why or why not. This was one of the areas I wish more people could or would use AI for. It was like having another writer in the room to weigh pros and cons with. After I finished the script, I sent it to the model to read over and give me it's opinion. The entire process was really efficient. I got through a 20 page script, start to finish in a little over 12 hours by just partnering with the model and getting quick feedback.

52	creativity_0052	Audiovisual	4	I'm a musician, so my projects range fro	"no questions, I'm ready to begin
"	"I run a production company that has a focus on music, books, video content, and games. Many of our projects cross over into any of these fields, or all of them. For example, I have an artist now who is out that has music videos, that are part of an interconnected world that connects to their music. All of these are connected to a mobile game we currently have in production for them. As a production house, we are able to work with our artists and content creators from end to end.
"	"That depends on the project. I will use my artist as an example. I am a producer, so I create their music the old-fashioned way, on my motif. From there, I send them the track, they write the lyrics, record and mix (in 1 of 3 studios). This is where AI comes in. I get the music, and listen to it, to get a feel for what it is telling me. I then begin working with some keywords and thoughts, creating a draft of the cover via AI. I draft my covers by AI usually. Once I have an idea of what I want, I then do the rest on my own. Back in the day, I would send this to a graphic designer, but with AI I am able to do this more efficiently on my own. From there, if the song is noteworthy, I will then work on a music video. With AI, this has become a 100 times more easier. I think of the theme, the style, and I do a mixture of AI and edits. It allows me to expand the reach of my production house, because sometimes we have 3-4 releases a week.
"	"Now I'm not going to disclose the name of the project, but we will call it ""Project A"". I received four completed songs from my artist, all with a dark, sort of Gotham city feel to them. Their lyrics are tight, the mixing is creative. I then sit with the music and get a picture in my mind of what I want. From there, I boot up Designer and create some ideas for the cover using AI. After a few revisions I have the core image I want. I then move it to the next level in Designer where I am able to edit the image directly, and add the different things a release needs on the cover (like title, etc.,). After ensuring the color and placements are right, I then press it. From there I send it to the distributor for review. This is a recent example of when I used it.

"	"As a writer and designer of games, a typical project would consist of the intersection between writing scenes for a level as well as thinking about how the game's design can tell its own story outside of traditional writing in the form of dialogue or cutscenes
"	"Initially, I come up with elements of the design and pitches for scenes and, once something is tangibly formed in my mind or on paper, AI comes in to find the deeper connections between the two pillars of writing and design that I missed but that I would probably have noticed myself across weeks or months. What this does is cut down the time between knowing what writing and design pitches to pursue and which ones are dead ends without much potential to grow and develop into something more than the initial pitch. The benefits of this process are that I am getting better at knowing which design and writing pitches will yield the potential to grow into something more ambitious. This symbiotic relationship between me and the AI is helping me learn and grow as opposed to heaping all of the creative effort on the AI.
"	"That moment has become key to my creative process and it is what I now chase. Do I have the instinct to pitch things at a higher and higher hit-rate that go on to become things that the AI notices greater potential in? It creates a back-and-forth loop where I start to point out to the AI some of the connections it missed which helps us understand each other more. On one recent screenplay project, I recalled something from an earlier chat with the AI months prior only for it to mention that it had already taken that into account. The benefit of that moment where we were both in sympatico and had 'clicked' is that I realized I could move on from the scene since we were both in alignment that we had wrung all of the scene's potential and there was nowhere else to go. Again, a huge way to save time as writer's are always in doubt about when to move on from a scene. This experience has caused me to be confident in my writing and waiting for the point where both the AI and I are in sympatico and I realize I can move on from the scene.

"	"I am a podcaster! I do many other things, like writing blog posts, scripting and recording meditations, and sometimes I create digital media that I sell... But first and foremost, I am a podcaster. I have been making pods for about 6 or 7 years. An average project for me is a large scale podcast episode, in which I'm formulating ideas, gathering notes, researching and mapping out the flow of the episode. Sometimes that takes over a month, depending on the topic.
"	"I reach for AI tools a lot for the research side of things. Whereas I used to spend hours googling some obscure thing I remembered reading about years ago, AI tools can find the exact piece of content I read and the actual scientific study it comes from. I can cite loose ideas to a chatbot, recalling that I had read about them in this context or that. The chatbot will always find exactly what I'm looking for, and will pull from more reputable sources if I request for it to do so.  I also reach for AI when I have multiple strings of ideas, and I'm struggling with how to format the episode. I find it useful to help me reign myself into a cohesive structure, without losing my creativity in the process.  Additionally, I always ask AI to write my episode summaries (the ones that get attached to the episodes). I struggle to write my own summaries, so I just paste in my transcript and ask the AI to summarize it for me, using a specific tone, and keeping SEO and my ideal listener in mind.
"	"I was working on a two part podcast and had a very messy notion page filled with random notes on the topic. Some notes were facts, personal opinions, quotes from famous people, my own stories or anecdotes, findings from articles or studies, etc. I explained to the AI (in a very long prompt) the main idea of the podcast episode, how I wanted the listener to feel and the tone I wanted to evoke. Then I copied and pasted all of my notes as asked it to make an outline WITHOUT altering any of my ideas. I stipulated that it could add suggestions that relate to the cohesiveness of the episode, but its main job was to re-order all of my concepts into a flow.

"	"I am a visual artist who specialises in textiles art, and so my work flow consists of conceptualising ideas, designing artworks and then executing these designs. There is also a fair bit of admin involved, for example if I am working with galleries who want to exhibit my work or individuals commissioning my work. Alongside this, I run a TikTok account documenting my processes and life in general. This has started to become a source of income for me within the past 6 months and also falls under the scope of creative work. For my TikTok videos, I have to come up with catchy concepts, film and then edit and post.
"	"I try to keep AI out of the actual ""making"" process of my work to be honest because I want it to completely be my own. However, I will use it for basic admin tasks and occasionally to brainstorm. For example, I might use it to help me come up with captions and hashtags to use on my social media, or drafting emails.
The brainstorming aspect mainly comes into play in relation to social media. For example, if I have an idea for a video but am struggling to think of a catchy opening line then I might turn to an AI chatbot to help.
"	"Most recently I used AI to help brainstorm an idea for a brand deal video that I made for TikTok. The brand deal was for a supermarket and I wanted to come up with a way to work this organically into my regular content, which is based around textiles and fashion. The conversation was short, I just asked it to generate a few basic ideas and then I used them as starting points to come up with my own concept. I never just use an idea that AI has come up with for social media, I always work it and add my own flair

"	"I work on writing research style blogs that have to do with niche topics, sort of a deep dive style! I also work on short form scripts for content! I have other creative tasks such as story or regular script writing that I do as well in my free time.
"	"There are a few occasions, usually when I am looking for new topics to discuss I will use Ai to find those. I want the topics to stay relevant and fresh so I will brainstorm a bit with Ai. I use it as a sounding board for ideas I am unsure about, and need a quick second opinion! I really use Ai for most steps, aside from direct content creation. Mostly as a tool to check ideas, check flow of a passage I wrote, or research
"	"I was researching cults and how the term has shifted meaning from its original use, and how we view it today. It shifted into comparing the tactics of cults to other areas, politics, social media and describing what human trait these all connect with. Ai was useful here to find a wide range of angels to tackle it from, because it's a big topic that can go in multiple directions, and as a way to check what i already had written to see if it had legs, or if there was a more interesting direction to take it. I used Ai to generate outlines to see the flow of potential angles, and for pointing out grammatical errors, or issues with redundancy.

"	"I write and run TTRPG games primarily using the D&D 5e system. I do this both professionally and as a hobby. While players of a D&D game play as a single unique character, the gamemaster essentially plays the role of any non-player characters as well as the environment-- reacting to what the player characters say and do. For me, creating an adventure or campaign involves outlining an overarching plot that may have different branching outcomes depending on what route the players take, creating unique NPCs, researching monsters and mechanics, etc.
"	"I mostly utilize AI for any brainstorming throughout the process. Whether this is in the very beginning to get inspiration for a primary conflict/antagonist, asking for unique personality traits I may want to give an NPC that the players will likely interact with, or anything similar. It is very difficult for me to pull creative ideas out of thin air, so a bit of idea prompting using AI is very helpful. A lot of times, I won't even necessarily end up using any of the exact ideas that the AI model gives me, but those ideas were able to spark other ideas from me.
"	"Most recently, I was writing a campaign that I would be running for 4 players. I had already worked with the players to help them create their characters and I wanted to find ways to fully integrate those characters into the story. I gave the chatbot an overview of each character and their background and asked for help brainstorming ways to weave that into the main plot or a secondary plotline. I felt very conflicted about it, as usual. I think that AI can be very useful and a wonderful accessibility tool for many, but there are many factors to consider, such as environmental impact and intellectual property.
I always want to make sure that I am not sacrificing my creative integrity by asking for something and using it word-for-word. Even if none of the players would care, I enjoy what I do and I would not want to fall into the habit of no longer using my own creativity and instead taking what an algorithm proposes based on a short prompt. I also feel great concern about how the AI model came to generate these ideas. Did someone else create them? Did those people give permission to have their work utilized for AI training purposes? But I feel that I am okay with the line I have drawn for myself, using it to spark inspiration, to avoid unintentionally stealing anyone's ideas and neglecting my creative drive.

58	creativity_0058	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"None that I can think of.
"	"I'm mostly a writer, so I go through the common stages, outlining, sloppy first draft, editing, second edit and proofreading. But I also do a lot of video creation: plotting, scripting, editing
"	"I do use AI in video scripting when I'm doing client videos. I don't use it for my own videos, because I don't feel like it can ever really capture my style. I've tried AI videos for clients, but find them VERY lacking. I usually have to do my own clip finding and change upwards of 90% of the clips every time. In the writing I do under my own name, or my most serious pen name, I would never use AI. It's not good enough, and my writing should be mine. If I ever did integrate it into that process, it would be for research only. But I do have some pen names where I've produced AI books. It takes tons of effort to get something decent out of AI, but it can be done with enough guidance.
I feel like my writing has (and should have) a very distinctive style. It's very emotive and visceral, and has a voice. It's my voice. I want it to be my voice. That's the point. People expect a certain level of quality from me, and I would never put my name on something I didn't write myself. But I also want to make money. That's what buys travel and coffee and things I need to live. It's hard to sell any book, so the more books you can put out there, the better your chances of profit. And I know what the market looks like. There are a lot of semi-decent to absolutely horrible books out there, so I don't feel terribly bad about adding AI-written books to that market, especially with the amount of guidance and editing I do to polish them up and make them semi-good. That said, my bestselling book that I wrote myself over 10 years ago still makes me the most money every month. So...? As for client video versus my own, my videos are personal videos that, again, need a personal voice. They are my own footage. They are already original. Clients pay me to create a YouTube channel with X number of videos on it just to profit off of adds or promote their businesses. They provide no footage and no ideas, so it's not really a personal channel. It's just advertising.
I haven't produced a book entirely with AI since last fall, but, at that time, AI was still an absolutely terrible writer. And I tried them all. It always made chapters too short, it was always surface level (no emotion, no depth). So, I might start with an idea of what needs to happen in this chapter. I guess that's where it starts. I don't just tell AI ""write me a book about X."" I come up with the chapter by chapter outline of what I want to happen first. So, basically, I ""write"" the whole story plot-wise and then I just let AI expand it. (It's definitely more effective this way).  Typically, I say ""This, this, and this needs to happen in this chapter,"" at which point the AI inevitably just writes those three things in like 500 words. So, then I take a portion of what it writes (if it's good) or tell it what to change (if it isn't), and tell it how to expand it - ""this needs to be a longer conversation,"" ""people do generally just chit-chat before they get into a deep topic,"" ""this needs more emotion,"" ""she should be upset here"". When it comes down to it, it's probably mostly about telling it how to be a good creative writer - expand this, make it more emotive, the feelings are wrong here. For the last AI novel I wrote, I was able to get a pretty close to polished draft by the end simply by being very demanding during the process. But this took a lot of effort. Often, I was doing only a chapter or even a half a chapter a day. That's almost as slow as writing a book from scratch. But I didn't have to do all the follow-up I do with a normal book (two, three, or four rounds of further editing), and writing takes a lot of brain power, so it was easier.

"	"I am a freelance screenwriter and film producer. I have worked independently, but I have also been on writing teams. Generally, I will come up with an idea for a screenplay, write it and then try to find a creative team to work with to seek funding. Occasionally I have been contracted to work on writing teams, but this is less frequent.
"	"So far, I have only used AI when it comes to more administrative tasks like composing emails or coming up with the wording for aspects of applications. The most creative use is potentially coming up with loglines/pitches. I generally have an idea of what I want the pitch to look like, but may outsource to AI if I have a mental block.
"	"The last project relied on the website Boosted to partially raise funding. I used AI to write the call to action for people who might be willing to donate some money to our creative work. In terms of how it felt, I think there's always a little bit of shame that comes with using AI in my line of work. Most of the creatives I work with are very concerned about the impact on our field, and I have a bit of anxiety that if it's obvious I've used AI for any part of the project it may impact my credibility when it comes to the rest of my work. I'm very cautious about using it, and will always rewrite the output to sound more like 'me.'
Honestly, it's time saving. I struggle slightly with structuring professional writing so AI's output generally has a structure I can use. I'll generally just change the wording of the sentences or the word choices. Prior to using AI, I would have searched for a template on Google (like I might search: Movie Pitch Template or Cover Letter Template) and then used the same process, so it feels pretty intuitive to use it in this way.

"	"I'm a novelist and I'm also learning how to write screenplays. With novels, my process is very chaotic but also very specific. I have no trouble coming up with ideas and I usually don't start writing until I know how it's going to end. This way, I make sure that I have a goal to shoot towards with every scene that I write. I don't outline and I also don't write in order. I also write very fast. I usually get a draft done within a month for a novel.
"	"My weakest points are the middle of the novel and also the lead up towards the final 1/3 of the novel. I often have trouble coming up with strong reasons within the plot for the heroine to go on the big journey away from home, leaving behind everything they know. I also use AI to help me come up with descriptors for spaces and places since I hate doing that part.
"	"I used it in YA fantasy novel to come up with descriptors for the unique city inside of an invisible magical shield. The city is adorned in gold and I wanted to try to come up with some unique ways to showcase this. I mostly like to get unique details rather than fully fleshed-out concepts. Just something to get the ideas jumpstarted for me. It felt great to have ideas to pick from instead of sitting around trying to do the grunt work myself. It can get disheartening to wait around for ideas to come.

61	creativity_0061	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"That sounds great, feel free to begin.
"	"I am a Creative Director for a physical product company that produces stationery, event decor items, and gifts. A typical project is usually a complete Design Collection that includes a number of items that are designed to coordinate. For event items, we create a collection that starts with an event invitation, and then add many coordinates such that the customer can create an entire event with matching items that we provide, such as signage, decor, favor tags and favors, wine bottle labels, thank you cards, menus, place cards, placemats, programs and more. So the project will start with inspiration gathering, idea generation, and then outlining the design ideas. Once we have the products designed, we focus on a marketing strategy and designs there, also.
"	"First we use AI in the idea generation stage, helping us figure out use cases for items and helping us really empathize with our very specific customer. This helps us come up with events we wouldn't necessarily think of on our own, such as back to school events, school dances, proms, and even funerals. Idea generation is a huge area where we use AI. That's just the beginning.
We input specific customer data and as much information as we know about our avatar, whom we've named ""Caroline,"" and is a 50 year old married mother of two, with teenage children, living in the US in a suburban area, with a high disposable income. AI has been very helpful with generating ideas about what would matter to this woman, what she cares about, and what event take place in her life which we may be able to help with. Once we've identified a new event to design into, we search Pinterest for visual inspiration and start our design process. The next place we lean very heavily on AI is with mockup generation. We need very specific mockups, such as blank easels with specific backgrounds like weddings in certain color palettes, and Midjourney allows us to create the very specific mockups we need.
"	"Sure, recently we created a line of gold foiled art prints and I needed some very specific mockups. They needed to be kitchens from very old world, high end mansions with a bright overall aesthetic that felt similar to Restoration Hardware, and I needed the walls to contain a number of frames in varying sizes that would still be dimensions that would work with our artwork. Adding ""Restoration Hardware"" to the prompt worked very well and the AI completely understood the vibe I was going for. It took a bit of time to get the frame sizes correct, as I was giving it quite a bit to have to figure out at once and there was a lot of detail that went into the images of the kitchens. Many of the frames were odd sizes for awhile, especially many square, but eventually I was able to get some really beautiful images with frames in the right sizes and they looked incredibly high and and realistic.
I loved the ability to decide on the fly that I wanted to see how the frames would look in gold rather than just black, and they actually looked way better than I would have thought. This is something that I could not have done prior. Typically I would have had to spend literally hours searching, scrolling through hundreds of mockup options, and NONE would be exactly what I wanted. Or I would have had to pay a photographer to shoot exactly what I wanted, but in this case that would have involved a significant amount of art direction, cost to rent a home for the day shoot, in addition to the photographer's fee which was about $2000 per day. Being able to create images that look nearly as incredible, and have so much control over every aspect, feels like a relief every time.

"	"My creative work has a couple of main branches that sometimes overlap: Visual art (drawing, painting) and filmmaking/video content (handmade stop motion films, animation, interviews).

My visual art projects typically involve doing commission work and designing/selling merchandise such as t-shirts. I also create concept art and assets for my film/video work.

My filmmaking/video projects include pre-production (concepts, planning, writing), production (building physical props, puppetry, lighting and filming scenes), and post-production (editing, sound design, visual effects).

Both of these main branches require promotion and marketing, which involves writing copy, voiceover work, and engagement with fans and followers.
"	"Typically it's at the beginning and finishing stages of a project. For example, for visual art I might use AI to help me brainstorm rough concepts or generate reference materials such as model poses or background elements. For filmmaking, AI can be used for spitballing ideas or doing some basic concept art to get the ball rolling. Films and video content also require plenty of post-production work, and AI can help with the process of, for example, compositing characters into a scene or rendering virtual environments and lighting.
"	"My filmmaking team recently discovered a tool for virtual environments that allows the user to use dynamic lighting within a virtual scene. This allows us to light a subject (character) using flat lighting in front of a green screen, key them out, and use the virtual lighting to light according to the environment we've built in Blender.. For a two-person team it's been a huge step toward creating scenes without having to pre-plan every single lighting setup, which keeps us from getting bogged down in the more technical aspects.

"	"OK so Part 1, the novel. I like to use AI to brainstorm ideas. I might say 'give me 5 ideas for a YA scifi that is genre-specific' and see what sparks from the suggestions. When I have a plot, I will run it by AI to see if there's any gaping plot holes that I was too close to see. And in the editing phase, an AI-powered grammar/spellcheck. For part 2, making covers, I use AI to guide me through any Photoshop process I'm not sure of. I might ask it to generate an image if I can't find a good one on the stock photo sites. And Photoshop has an AI feature that extends an image - I find that really handy. For the third area, social media, I have AI help me with using Canva, and also suggesting colours that go well together for certain themes. I also ask AI for hashtag help.
"	"I really find AI indispensable! So, for the brainstorming, as I said I would start with an initial ""come up with 5 ideas for a story"". Oftentimes, one idea will spark an idea for me. It might not be exactly what the AI suggested, but it's ""inspired by"". Then I will ask for a more specific plot, incorporating my ideas as I go. The finished plot line is pretty much my idea rather than the AI, but I find the process really gets my creativity ticking - similar to how a writing prompt is used in creative writing classes.

I also frequently use AI to help me understand possible directions my writing might take. For example, to help me devise a few different potential outlines based on a batch of material.
"	"Sure. I recently gathered the prompts and responses generated in a very long and winding conversation about deep philosophical topics like consciousness and how we might recognize the first sparks of such things in AI models. I provided the conversations to the AI model and had it organize and categorize the material. There was much overlap and duplication in the conversations, which I had the model identify. In the end I ended up with a well organized batch of shorter conversations, which logically flowed together. I ensured that the model left all of the text from the conversation as is, verbatim, as I still wanted the material to be the authentic conversations which took place.

I have also used it for placeholder art throughout the development process. This gives me a rough Idea of how I imagine the final product looking. Usually my process looks like this. For example, I have an idea for a character. I will create some prompts to generate a character based on what I am looking for. I will iterate on the character in terms of overall appearance and graphic styling. If this is to be a 3D character, I will then bring that image into an image to 3D AI model . From there, the model will be brought into blender for cleaning up and getting it ready to use in game. The process is similar for 2D items but instead of bring it into blender, I will uses something like photoshop to prepare it. I am mostly using local AIs through ComfyUI as well as some online ones like ChatGPT.
"	"On of my current projects is a laid back casual game. My intention for the graphics were to have them cute and 3D with a cartoony vibe. I used chat gpt to generate images for the characters and objects that will appear in the game. I prompted it to generate an image that is cartoony and 3D with a description of the object or character. When I get an image that I think can work, I either use chatgpt or some other local AIs to generate images for multiple angles of the object. I then take those images and put them in HunYuan3D multiview to generate the 3D model with textures. It is then taken into blender to clean up the mesh and textures, rig the and animate the model if needed. It felt both amazing and frustrating using AI for this as when it works, it is absolutely amazing. However, the realty  is that there is often inconsistencies and unwanted artifacts that appear. This can actually cause a lot of wasted time trying to fix this issues. So right now I would say it is a balancing act. Yes, it can greatly increase the time to create an asset but there is also the potential for it to take longer. With repeated prompts and retries to get a decent base as well as the time taken to fix it up, it can sometimes be faster to just create it from scratch.

"	"So I'm a musician, composer, and sound designer for short films, theatre, podcasts ocassionally. Depending on the project, I could be composing and producing music, creating sound effects, or writing songs.
"	"Sometimes, if I'm stuck with lyrics for a song (not my strong point!) I will discuss the themes and relevance within the piece with ChatGPT, or sometimes I will write some words and ask the model to continue. I then edit these heavily, sometimes completely ditch them but usually I at least get a new idea to spark my own process.
"	"I recently worked as Music Director for a youth theatre production. I spent most of my time on arranging music for the young musicians in the cast but I also had to write two original songs using ideas that were brainstormed with the cast of the show. I took the themes and ideas we had discussed and gave the info to ChatGPT and asked, and regenerated the lyrics for the songs. I brought back a couple of versions to the cast and together we edited them together to get the finished songs. The music had already been written.
Not really. It is different but I treated it the same as if a person had written the lyrics.

"	"My typical projects involve creative writing in either poetry or creative nonfiction. For poetry, I've developed a generative system that helps me produce a large amount of work quickly and access my subconscious more easily. For creative nonfiction, I write in fragments of memories and then try to loop them together into a narrative, which I often find quite tricky. When I worked in an art museum, I used AI to help me write the paragraphs next to the painting at a tenth-grade reading level. I would conduct the research, decide on the structure, and then ensure it was accessible to an audience at a tenth-grade reading level through AI.
"		"I'm working on a memoir about mortality and the loss of a lot of loved ones to suicides and overdoses throughout my twenties. Obviously, trauma creates fragmented memories. Further, the most beautiful moments are split seconds, or a few minutes, and don't really fit into a cohesive narrative. I've worked on ways to bridge this gap, but AI could certainly help me identify those gaps or consider other structures that would suit my style as it is.
I've tried it a little bit to help me bridge gaps, and I've found it helpful, but it just doesn't change that I don't really think in terms of narrative, so it doesn't make the work of changing it into something that's not naturally any more pleasant. I have not yet used it to help me brainstorm other structures.

69	creativity_0069	Content writing	2	I work on writing research style blogs t	"That sounds great. I do not have any questions right now. What do you have for me?
"	"I work creatively in a few different ways. I do a lot of writing, but mostly in the areas of copywriting, email and text message writing, and sometimes even proposals. A typical project can involve taking information from other sources (transcripts, articles, emails, you name it) extracting relevant information, and presenting it in a clear and informative way. Depending on the project, the presentation can be customer-facing, client/lead facing, or be used internally to take away unneccessary information to give my boss what she needs. (Think almost like a TLDR.) The output varies. Sometimes I require bullets, spreadsheets, emails, documents, and even images. Do you have any other questions about my work?
"	"AI is most helpful in extracting important information. I can tell it what I'm looking for and it will take a large amount of data and give me what is most important from it. This saves tons of time. It is also useful in helping me write copy in a way that conveys a message quickly so I'm not sitting stuck on wording or questioning whether or not what I am trying to say to someone ""makes sense."" When the AI writes it, I can read it and if it doesn't make sense to me, then we have a conversation until it does, rather than me attempting that conversation with myself and getting confused. AI also helps me brainstorm, finding different ways to look at a problem and come up with solutions faster than if I were to stare at something that has me stumped. It basically takes a lot of the pressure off so that I can provide results to people instead of presenting more problems.
"	"I have an ongoing situation that I use ChatGPT for. Every day I keep track of the things I did during the day. I have a conversation in ChatGPT specifically devoted to telling it what I did for the day and it helps me identify action items for the next day. One thing it also does is to catch anything that may be slipping through the cracks and reminds me to follow up. For example, if I told it on Monday that I emailed [REDACTED] about X, but it hasn't seen anything regarding [REDACTED] on my list for 3 days, it will give me an action item of following up with [REDACTED]. I may not have thought to follow up with [REDACTED] if my attention was elsewhere, so this method has been helping me to not let anything slip through.

"	"I'm a TV writer. Most recently (the past 3 years) that has been in development. I pitch an idea for an original TV series to buyers, then they pay me to develop and write the pilot episode. The hope is that it would continue to be developed into a produced pilot and then a series, but I have not made it that far yet with my original projects.
"	"I use AI for research both at the brainstorming stage and then in a more granular way when I need specifics for a scene
Other research methods involved mostly web searches, but occasionally I would read books on a subject. Previous pitch I sold was about quantum computing, and I didn't use AI at all in my research. I watched a lot of educational videos on YouTube, read articles I searched for on the internet, and read a novel where quantum computing was an element of the storytelling for context. On my current project, using AI, my research time is cut down significantly. It's a legal drama and I don't have any formal legal training, so I use to ask how certain legal processes work -- the name of motions, or order of events in a lawsuit. I will run hypotheticals by it to if my imagined scenario has any way of working in reality or if there are any real world examples to back it up.
Especially with legal things, I feel I have to check much more frequently. I'm sure you've heard about actual lawyers who use AI to draft briefs and it's full of made up caselaw. I've caught many hallucinations in my research (not just legal, but it seems to be more common in that area for some reason). When I've settled on something through my AI research, I will do traditional research of Googling or reaching out to an expert like a friend who's a lawyer to double check things. I wouldn't want to waste that friend's time checking dozens of ideas when I haven't settled on the one that's going to end up in the script yet.
It's very annoying. I hate the anthropomorphizing of technology. If it makes it easier to use/interact with (like using natural language instead of code) that's great. But I don't need an AI to apologize to me when I catch it making stuff up. I need it to do better. When I catch a hallucination and tell the model something like ""I just looked that up and it's wrong,"" the response is often something like ""Oh my gosh! You're so right, and I apologize for my mistake..."" And so then I wonder, if all it took was me saying it was wrong (with no cited source) for it to reverse, then why doesn't the model just ask itself if it's wrong before giving ANY answer, and check itself? Or even worse, it makes me wonder if the reversal/apology is wrong (maybe the original thing was ultimately true and my fact-checking was the part that was wrong), and the model's just trying to make me want to keep using it. The way it handles mistakes and the certainty with which it presents information is very disconcerting.
"	"I'm also writing a feature screenplay on the side -- it's an action/adventure in the vein of the Mission Impossible franchise. I came up with a really clever idea for a setpiece -- a heist in a world-famous location -- but then suddenly worried if I was ripping off a scene from an already existing Mission Impossible movie, so I asked an AI model if Mission Impossible ever had any sequences set in that location, and it said it did and mentioned the exact movie, described the characters in the scene, and how it played into the plot. Now, I've seen all the movies, but it's possible I'd forgotten this... so I asked at what minute-mark the scene took place, the AI told me, then I watched the movie at that point and the scene the AI described didn't exist. In my own subsequent research, I read the script and the scene did not exist there either. At no point in any Mission Impossible movie was there a scene set at this location, nor was the location even mentioned in passing. So that was an example of AI being incredibly unhelpful in my research.

"	"I am a novelist and also a freelance content and copy writer. I use AI far more in my work as a content writer than when working on my novels. I work for various clients across a variety of topics but a typical project would be working for a hotel chain locate in a certain country who would ask me to write a series of articles about tourism in that area. Some such articles might cover: when is the best time to travel to said country, Some top tips for travelling there with children or pets, What are the best festivals and local events to catch in that country, etc.
"	"I use AI (generally ChatGPT) in the early stages of the article process. I first ask the model the basic premise of my article, I ask it to list the top ten festivals for tourists in France or to give me 20 tips for travelling to Portugal with children or when is the best time to visit Bali and why?
I will then use this information as a jumping off point for my own research, looking up each point that the model made, fact checking it and adding more information as I find it. 

Once I have all my research done and I have done a rough first draft, of the articles body, I tend to put that draft into a chat and ask the model to create an introductory paragraph, I do this because I always struggle to  come up with the first lines of an article, and staring at a blank page is not helpful, once the model has given me a starting point the rest of the article flows much more easily. However I always rewrite that introduction myself during my edits so that no part of the article is AI written as many of my clients prohibit this. 

I may also feed the finished article into a chat and ask the model to create a except of around 60 words, an SEO-optimised tag line and a tweet linking to the article. I do this because the model will often pull out points that I had not realised were key and I can then blend the model and my own highlights to create strong links. 

I have custom preferences set for my chats so that the model knows the clents preferese tone and style and what the end goal for the article is.
"	"In another project for a tech comparison site I was editing a series of articles comparing very similar tech products. part of my role was to add in pros and cons for each of the products in each of the articles. It was very repetitive work and when doing it myself I struggled to come up with varied pro/cons for each product each time, especially since the article and research wasn't my own so I did not know the products all that well. 
I fed the almost complete articles into a chat and asked the model to come up with 3 different pros and cons for each product mentions using information from the articles and the models knowledge of the products as a whole, stressing that each one should be different from the others and the model should avoid using generic information that could apply to all of them. 
Again the preferences were set so the model knew which tone and language to use. 
I found this method sped up my editing process considerable. I had to fact check some of the information but doing so was much faster than me struggling to create 50+ individually varied pro/cons on my own.

"	"I like reaching for AI tools to assist me in a variety of ways. For example, I may be short on time, or just struggling to understand something within a script in which case I will use an AI tool to help me in the process of script analysis and understanding the scene as a whole, or even a line that I was unsure about. I may enquire as to different styles of acting required by sides I was given. For example, if I'm sent audition sides without much context about the project, I may use an I tool to aid my research and understand the likely genre and style of acting required. When crafting letters I also like to use AI as a second set of eyes. And I like to catch up with AI tools on some more general stuff, like working on my branding and brainstorming plotlines and scenes which would be good for me to film to show my skills and strengths. I may also enquire about some contractual information, as an initial set of eyes so I can look more into any potential issues found.

Since I could not get support from my know industry contacts, I worked on it on my own with the support of an AI tool.

I discussed some worries, and the AI helped me to formulate some questions to ask to clarify a few things.

73	creativity_0073	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"Sounds good, let's go.
"	"I'm an author of fiction, mainly Science Fiction and Fantasy, so a typical project for me would be a novel or short story that I write. My projects usually involve working for a set amount of time a day to get the words down for the first draft. I then need to revise this draft in what is a 'story draft' that is mostly to make sure the plot and other elements make sense and work, this is followed with a 'grammar draft' to check for errors like punctuation. Finally I aim for a proofread from a few people. Finally the project gets released, but then there are additional areas for marketing and promoting the book, depending if it is something I'm self-publishing.
"	"So, I've been using AI recently across all stages in various capacities so I'll go through each area with examples. First up, during the first drafting stage I've been using AI to help with research as well as finding similar works that meet the tone, genre, or overall ideas of the story I'm working on. This has included exploring the main key touchstones of a genre (e.g. What are some key components of a Survival Horror story?, What are some successful Survival Horror books, Films, TV shows and music that evokes the atmosphere). Using this I can develop some inspiration as well as using the music while writing to set the tone. 

During the drafting stage, I use AI to have a quick check of chapters as I write them (or sections depending on the word count) and ask for general feedback. I am careful to specify I don't want suggestions for the story, as I feel this could influence my writing, instead I ask for criticism on the overall tone  and feel. I use the previous conversation  to continue this so the model's know my aim (e.g. Survival Horror Genre) so it can provide relevant feedback. During this process, I sometimes ask the model to lay out the story so far into a story-template such as 'Save The Cat' or 'Three Act Structure' which can help provide a skeleton look at the story to help me navigate and see where the story is sitting in terms of plot. 

Once the first draft is completed. I often ask the AI to provide full feedback on the story and also ask questions such as 'What would a reader feel is missing? Are there any plot points that do not feel fully resolved?' to help me prepare for the 'story draft' I mentioned earlier. 

I usually work through the story draft without using AI too much, as this is the stage where I'm trying to tidy it up so less involvement makes this easier. 

For the Grammar Draft, I usually go through the draft with a checker such as Grammarly, and then once its all done I'll use another AI model to provide feedback and catch anything that may have been missed. This is about the end of the AI use for the story, as I'll turn to human proof readers for the final stages.  

However, once release, I have used AI to help create social media content, but this is an area I'm still quite new at using it for.
"	"Sure. So, a recent project was a short story I was working on for an Southern Gothic story I was working on. In this case I used the AI as I described earlier and gathered several inspiration ideas and music which lead to a playlist of music I used when writing. I then posted each chapter into the model for feedback, and the first thing that I really like was having that instant feedback on something which, as a writer, you often don't get feedback until you've finished the whole thing which can take a long, long time!! As such, this provided me with a great motivation to keep going as well as helping me to refine and see my ideas coming to life within the story structure. It really made the process flow better. I did have to reiterate the 'give me feedback not suggestions' aspect a couple of times, but this is something I can see developing as I use the model more often.

"	"I am an assistant audio engineer at a recording studio. The majority of the work I do involves recording musicians, and mixing/mastering records after the fact.
"	"The past couple of years there have been a number of AI audio tools that have hit the market. One I have been using just today is a 'stem splitter' called SpectraLayers. There are a number of tools now that are able to create individual audio files for the different instruments in a recording even if you only have a single stereo file to begin with. There can be artifacts, and inconsistencies but it has been improving consistently over time. This used to be a simply impossible task prior to AI. You could try to EQ a recording to isolate a single instrument but it would always be nowhere close to the level achievable now. There are also AI tools by a company called Izotope that do a great job at analyzing audio and removing buzzes, hums, clicks, noise and reverb. I also use ChatGPT in my day to day in a few situations.
It tends to be my first resource when I am looking for information on a piece of gear, or for a creative solution to a signal flow issue I'm running into. For example I have been researching getting a footswitch to integrate into the talkback system of our console. I used chatgpt to find possible products, and ask how that could be achieved or if there are any easier ways to achieve the job. Also, I tend to use ChatGPT a lot for planning tasks, so planning sessions or setting up schedules i use it for. Finally while writing a piece it will sometimes come out to help someone come up with a rhyme or some inspiration for lyrics
"	"Is that including the audio AI tools?
Today I have been tasked with trying to take a rough single recording of a live performance of a few bands and split the audio into several different tracks and try my best to make it salvageable so that it can be mixed in the future. This task would have been all but impossible without the tool I am using. We pretty much would have been forced to just use the recording as is but now, I can split the instruments and apply separate processing and levels to each piece of the band to make it sound passable. It feels great to be able to use a recording that was not ideal in the first place. A lot of times in the past when you would mess up during the recording process you were just screwed, either rerecord or accept the bad sound, but now nearly anything is salvageable.

I'm a solo developer for this project, so I'm involved in every aspect of development, from planning, to development, testing, etc.
"	"I have to really utilize AI in the planning stages, as the ideas already exist. What I've found thus far is that AI fills the gaps when official documentation doesn't meet my needs.
"	"At first, I put a considerable amount of time and effort into scouring through Google's official documentation for modern Android development, however, as I continued in the earliest stages of product planning and development, I learned that my time was better served utilizing AI to help answer questions about my project.
I think its important to note that I have years of experience with coding, but not much experience with Android. By that, I mean, compared to someone who might be considered very skilled. Thus, I began to realize early on that AI was very capable of assisting with ensuring that I understood the basic concepts, kept my data layer and UI layer separate, helped to ensure that my files would work together, and most importantly, assisting with debugging and errors.

"	"I struggle with writing TOO much when it comes to performance descriptions, website blurbs, social media posts, gig quotes, and emails to clients. AI helps me improve my writing skills to be more concise and use key ""action"" terms that help the website get more hits. I keep collections of messages and quotes to quickly reply to quote requests, so I reach out to AI for help with the wording every few weeks or so, or when I need help writing a ""short"" social media post about an upcoming event. I also design cover images for some events (combining our promo images with those from the client or event page) so I occasionally get help from AI with the arrangement of images (without using AI generated graphics).

I started out by providing the existing ""blurb"" along with a list of ideas for what needed to change.

One of my clients is a clothing company, and they often ask for me to do edits like changing the color of something, adding details, or switching fabrics, and this is where I use AI to make that process faster. I also often use it when I want to change the background of an image, either swapping it out for a completely different background or removing unwanted items from an image.
"	"Recently I was editing a picture for a client where they wanted me to add red bias tape to the back slit of a dress along with an embroidered heart. If I had to do this ""by hand"" it would have taken me a couple of hours, searching for images of the things that needed to be added and making them fit into the existing image without looking like they were pasted on.

The basic idea of the show is after an apocalyptic event a wife tries to find her husband but starts to realize that maybe the event was caused by someone and not something. My typical project is creating a story line, characters and the finally animating it all into a scene.
"	"I use the AI to deepen the lore of the world and the characters inside. For example, there is a government faction that believes they know what's best for the world so I used the AI to create names, background stories and beliefs so that I don't have to spend too much time on those details. It also helps that I can just ask the AI about a character rather than have to find what I'm looking for through pages and pages of notes. I also use the AI to link in-series events with real world events so that the show borders on reality but is still a little sci-fi. I also use the AI to create reference images that I base the characters on so that I can get a front and side view from the AI and model it out from there. I also use the AI to plan out the plot line for each season and each episode. I know the rough direction that I want the show to go but the AI gives me some out of the box options that I wouldn't have thought of otherwise. And lastly, I also use the AI to create textures for UV maps.
"	"I am creating a teaser trailer for social media and I used the AI for a lot of it. One of the first things was making sure I wasn't giving away too much of the story. So I told the AI what my vision was and it suggested ways to make it more mysterious. I also used the AI to explain how to do different techniques within Blender (3d modeling software) such as parallax images. The AI to me is like an assistant that has great ideas and I never feel like it's taking anything away from the creative process. The scenes and characters are all based on my descriptions and the AI helps me take it from good to great.

If I am looking to create designs for a certain holiday or more general event, I will ask the AI tool or service for some key motifs or design elements/ slogans that I can implement in the design. Same goes for whatever may be trending currently that I would like to sketch to draw attention to my social pages.

I haven't watched the show, so I asked for some key themes of the show that I could use on a banner. The AI told me that the trending topics are Team Conrad vs. Team Jeremiah and gave me a quote from each character that I then drew up n a banner. I felt okay with this because I was just using the AI as a helping tool, and not to make the design for me.

"	"I write both children's stories and picture books as well as how-to articles, short stories, and books for adults. I use AI more for my children's writing and for picture book design. I do use it for inspiration sometimes, but I use it more often for helping me come up with image ideas because I'm not an artist; I self-publish so being able to see images and work with those helps a lot.
"	"I have to split text so it spreads onto different pages for picture books. These are simple books, so the images have to say a lot. I can sometimes work with a few images created by AI and manipulate those or make changes to those to keep going with the story. The images also give me ideas for directions I can go and little tweaks I can make in the text.
"	"Right now I'm working on a PB that takes place in a zoo at night with several different animals that support the protagonist who finds himself in hot water beginning on page 1. For example, the MC is a hippo, and some of the supporting characters are a parrot, family of lions, family of monkeys, and a mouse. I've had this idea for a few years, and I even had someone work on the illustrations for it before, but I was not satisfied at all with what the artist came up with. On the other hand, the AI has came up with several really good ideas that have matched my vision of what I want this to look like, which is great! If only it could teach me how to draw the images :). That would be phenomenal because as I said, I am not an illustrator. If I was, then I could bring what's in my head to life better than what I can now. The AI does help a lot with pulling together elements that I need in the images; for example, in one image for this PB I needed the hippo drinking / gulping all of the water out of his watering hole. It took a few attempts, but I did get an image of him slurping up the water with a very full belly and mouth, which led me to thinking that an even better image would be him lying down with a huge belly, an almost empty watering hole, and an ""I can't possibly take one more sip!"" look on his face.

I document my writing process on social media (I use X) and sometimes post images representing various scenes I'm currently working on.
"	"I do the actual writing myself, but I often use AI for the research, and it's very helpful! As an example, for my current book, I have a character who had a medical issue, and I used AI to tell me exactly what doctors would likely do in her situation upon her arrival to the emergency room. What procedures and tests would happen and in what order, what they would likely say to her, when she would get answers, how long she would have to be hooked up to breathing machines or recovering after surgery, etc. Another thing AI has been useful for is creating art and video for book covers, trailers, and other promotional materials. I always made my own book covers using stock art in the past, so rather than using AI to generate a completed cover, I use it to make various elements that I edit together creatively. Same with the book trailers. I get a bunch of short clips and make them into a film. More recently, since it's improved at making text, I've also been using it to design unique text for my titles. During the writing process, I sometimes describe the scene I'm working on, get an image, and post it to my X account with an update on the writing process and the current scene. This is an interesting way to share what I'm creating.
"	"For my most recently released post-apocalyptic series, I used AI to create a book trailer. I used Midjourney to make the images and Runway to animate them. I also used video clips made in Pika video generator. At the time, I thought it was really cool, but this was a couple years ago, and the video tools have improved so much since then that it looks pretty bad now. I've always really enjoyed editing film, so these projects are great fun for me.

"	"So AI is not involved in the actual creative process for making a terrain carving. Any creative aspects originate entirely from my mind. I do find AI to be useful for secondary aspects of my art, however. I've used AI to generate a business plan template, to generate keywords and tags for my website, to create a product listing template, and to play around with logo generation, among other things. I do have other interests like songwriting, in which I've attempted to use AI for the generation of creative content, mainly lyrics. But these attempts have not proven to be very successful.
"	"Somewhat surprisingly, and thanks to Google Note's version history feature, here's a sample of an AI generated lyrical verse that I rejected. I found it just too explicit and a bit contrived. Further prompting, attempting to emulate certain styles proved unsuccessful as well.   ""Your billions can't buy freedom, your mansions built on sand,
The air you breathe, the water, they slip through your command.
You can't pay, won't pay? We echo it right back,
No price tag on justice, no deal on freedom's track.""

83	creativity_0083	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"Sounds good, I don't have any questions.
"	"I vary from screenwriting, songwriting, and copywriting. A typical screenwriting project might be a pilot episode of an original idea or a spec episode of an existing show I like. For songs, I mostly write pop or pop rock songs, but I also help a friend with some briefs for KPOP. For copywriting, it depends on the client, but the most common is event announcements for an organization's newsletter.
"	"I mostly just use AI for pre-planning or brainstorming for teleplays. For example, I have an original concept involving characters from different classic literature novels being in the same world, so I've used AI to remind myself of the plots of those novels (Moby Dick, Alice in Wonderland, etc.) and do some in depth character analysis of both major and obscure characters from those books. For spec scripts, I might ask it for a summary of a previous season or also do a character dive on the character from the show. For songwriting, I've asked for rhymes or if the syllable pattern makes sense. For copywriting, I usually just run it through for proofreading and ask if it can be improved or clarified.
"	"This was more for fun, but I wrote a spec script of the golden girls. I ran some of the dialog through and asked it if the dialog I wrote was believable/true to the characters from the show. Like capturing Dorothy's sarcasm, Sophia's mischievousness, Blanche's flirtatiousness, and Rose's gullibility. I also provided it with an outline of the plot i came up with and asked if there were any gaps and if there was already an episode with a similar plot.
It felt okay. I crave feedback all the time and have a thick skin, so I did feel it was a little too nice. It felt like it was just telling me what I wanted to hear, tbh, basically affirming that I did a good job at capturing the characters. I had some reservations of ""feeding"" my own creative work to the model, but since it was just a spec script of an existing IP from over 30 years ago, I didn't ultimately feel like my creative work was at risk of being consumed by the model and used without my permission.

"	"I'm a writer.  I maintain a small website and frequent a couple of social media platforms as a way of directing traffic to said website.  On my website, I alternate between short stories, longform stories, and nonfiction topics (mostly about roleplaying games and using hard science to develop the background of fictional settings).  I make my money by selling products related to my writing, such as shirts with my more popular characters on them or self-published books.  It doesn't make a lot of money, but I do alright; I average a few thousand visitors a week.
"	"I'll give an example of a project I'm working on right now.  I'm getting ready to write a series of activity books- those books that are popular with kids, that contain puzzles, coloring pages, and bits of writing.  I thought it would be fun to develop the lore for a singular setting using these books, ostensibly oriented toward children but actually containing enough information that they would be useful for adults who wanted to run a roleplaying game (such as D&D) in said setting.  First, though, I need to establish the setting, and that's where AI has come in.  I'm using an AI to bounce ideas off of and see what needs to be more developed, and whether what I've got planned makes sense.  For example, I initially thought of a world that was both large and had lower gravity than Earth; the AI I talked to pointed out that something weird would have to be going on under the surface in order for that to make sense, and then suggested that the world was hollow- which I loved!  As of a couple hours ago, I was asking the AI what the weather would be like in my setting, and I used its response to build a description in a vignette that I plan on including in the first activity book.
"	"In general, the process looks like this:  I present the AI with a suggestion, and effectively ask ""if real-world physics applies, how would this work?""  The AI will, depending on what specific thing I'm asking about, either explain what physics says would happen, or it will point out (like with the too-big-for-low-gravity setting above) that normally that couldn't work, then suggest ways to change what I've got so that it could work.  If the former happens, I'll introduce a complication to add depth to the setting (e.g. ""What would the tides look like with three moons?"").  If the latter happens, I'll go with the suggestion that has the most interesting implications, or sometimes I'll go with none of them because some offhand comment by the AI has inspired me to go in a different direction.  Either way, the process repeats itself.  I'll often dip into other sciences; in my current project, I've touched on astrophysics, orbital mechanics, physics, atmospheric science, avionics and biology, and I'm still working on it.

"	"I am a screenwriter and my project usually involves writing a feature length screenplay, revising a screenplay, collaboration with others on co-writing scripts, perhaps writing short scripts (fewer than 20 pages). Last year I sold two animated short scripts. I also do standup comedy, so another creative project I would do would be to write a set that would be delivered anywhere between 5-15 minutes in length. Finally, I'm thinking about adapting one of my favorite screenplays into a novel (but I haven't done that yet).
"	"With standup, I have inputted parts of my set into AI to help me brainstorm ways to extend a joke, or do call-backs from jokes earlier in my set. Recently, I used AI extensively to come up with many angles on the theme: women over 50 are invisible in society. 

As for my screenplays, I've primarily used it to do character building: quickly access popular names of people of a specific generation, or even quickly understand what their personalities could be based on their enneagram number.
"	"Like I said, the most recent one that comes to mind is I was working on a standup set where I wanted to talk about how women over 50 are invisible. I asked AI to provide me with some possible answers to ""I'm so invisible..."" It provided me one that I partially used: ""I'm so invisible, even my Apple watch didn't record my steps."" I used that answer, but then added (after a beat): ""I mean, I don't exercise, but still!""

"	"I usually start off my process by talking to an LLM and instructing it to guide me through the process, including schedules, checklists, and required research for that project. Example prompts include:
""I'm writing a high fantasy novel set in a temperate jungle climate. Give me a list of countries and cultures to research, create a short description of how this may differ from a typical eurocentric based fantasy, and walk me through a detailed process of drafting including Character Arcs, 3 levels of outlining the project as a whole, and how to pace scenes and chapters.""
""I am working on a reality shifting guided meditation for a Henry Danger based DR. Please give me 3 different examples for guided meditation practices, a list of 15 immersive affirmations, a brief overview of the show including the general vibes, and a short 2nd person narration of waking up in Swellview and attending SVHS.""
"	"Recently I used AI to speed run a creative project by asking it to create a 7 day fast drafting guide. It had to hit all of the major writing concepts such as in-depth world building, full characters arcs, plot progression, narrative themes, and tips for foreshadowing. 
I immediately started outlining the draft in another document and would either ask questions, request it go in more depth for a specific day, or to continue with the next day.
I actually ended up outlining a 4 part novel series with 12 main characters over the course of 5 days, and am preparing to move onto the research phase. Though I will probably try a different LLM for the part because, while the model did well with the planning phase, it was not very helpful in recommending good resources for learning more about Thailand and Thai fairy tales. 
Overall I was happy with the first results and it was extremely helpful for someone with ADHD as well as other neurological disorders that make staying on track incredibly difficult. The model was also very encouraging.

88	creativity_0088	Content writing	2	I work on writing research style blogs t	"Sounds good. I'm curious about what we'll talk about.
"	"I'm a freelance copyeditor, proofreader, and occasionally a writer. I have regular clients who give me work each week, and more sporadic bundles of work, too. I work mostly with nonfiction, short-form stuff for organizations, preparing blog posts and sometimes reports.
"	"I don't use AI too much, to be honest. But sometimes I'll ask AI for help with a particular section that's giving me trouble. Like if a certain paragraph is reporting lots of data, this can be annoying to express smoothly, so I'll ask an AI for advice.
"	"Sure thing. A specific example involves a blog post that was reporting participant ratings on a certain audio streaming service. This paragraph needed to include a wealth of ratings plus statistical information. I've anonymized it here, but something like ""The mean rating for [service A] was 61.7, and for [service B] was 67.8; the difference was statistically significant ((t(104) = 2.28, p = .025). For [service A] the 95% confidence ranged from 58.2 to 68., and for [service B] it ranged from 66.7 to 76.1.""

It's striking a balance between being casually readable and more technical. Some of the readers of this particular site's posts are just casual readers, and some are professionals who want the statistical context, so just cutting down on the numbers isn't really an option.
I asked the AI, I think it was ChatGPT, how I make this more readable without removing any of the numbers. It first suggested using a table, which I think is an OK suggestion, but we rejected it ultimately since that particular blog post already had a couple tables. So instead it said to use a couple bullet points, one for Service A, and one for Service B, and putting the significance information immediately below.
I went with the bullet points, as that was easily readable while still containing all the information needed.

"	"Well, I am a graphic designer.  I primarily design creative supplies for crafters.  Some examples of the types of things I create are digital scrapbook kits, stickers, junk journal ephemera and supplies, digital papers, and labels.  A typical project begins with me deciding on a theme and a color palette, then exploring design ideas, then initial sketches and detailed design work, refinement, and digital packaging.
"	"I use AI throughout several steps.  If I don't already have a color palette and theme decided on, I start there with AI assistance.  I typically will say something like ""I am creating a fall themed scrapbooking kit.  Give me an image with some color palette ideas.""  I might also upload a color palette I'm going to use and ask AI to give me 10 theme ideas.  Once I have decided on my color palette and theme, I will do some brainstorming work on my own.  After this step, I will go to AI and give it my color palette and theme, then ask it to generate a list of things I could include in a scrapbook kit.  From there, I will use AI to generate inital sketches or ideas for the style I might use for some of the items.  This could look something like telling the AI I'm creating a happy mail themed scrapbook kit with a color palette (I'd upload the image).  I would ask it to create an image with several ideas for stickers or elements I could include.  I typically will have a pretty long conversation with AI where I continue to ask it to generate idea images.  After this step, I go back and look at all the ideas it gave me, and I will take note of what I want to include in my kit.  At this point, I go to my Procreate app and start drawing/creating things.  Occasionally if I am having trouble, I'll have AI create an element of something tricky - like maybe I can't get my squirrel to look like a squirrel.  Once it generates something, I will download one I like and use it as a reference for my artwork.  Once I've completed my kit, I will typically upload it to AI and ask it to tell me what it is missing or what would make it look better.
"	"Yes, I actually just began a new kit 2 days ago and had a lengthy conversation with AI.  I first provided my color palette image and theme I had decided on - which was the fall happy mail theme.  I first asked it a more broad request, which was something like ""I am creating a fall happy mail themed scrapbooking kit.  Give me an image of a bunch of elements you think would work well for it using these colors.""  I then asked it to give me more a few times until there were quite a few to choose from.  It started using the wrong colors at one point, so I refined the results by reminding it that it needs to use only the colors I provided.  Once I had a large selection of ideas, I narrowed it down.  For example, one of the elements it gave me was an owl.  I asked it to provide me with an image of several different owl element designs similar to the one it already gave me.  I did this with any elements I was interested in, like squirrels, cats, mushrooms, foliage, leaves, envelopes, etc.  I then asked it to create a sheet of word art.  I went through the same process, asking it to create more of the types I liked and refine them as needed.  I am currently at the stage of drawing my kit.  While drawing, I will open my conversation with AI to see some of the ideas it gave me and go from there.  Once I'm done drawing everything I think I'll need, I'll create a kit preview myself in Photoshop, then upload an image of it to AI to ask for its feedback on how I can improve it.

"	"Sometimes clients don't have a set design in mind, so I use generative AI to help me brainstorm design ideas. I've also used it to generate alternative angles of pieces if I was only provided with one view. 3D pieces typically need to look good from every angle, but the 2D images I work from only show one, so AI has been helpful to fill in gaps.

I recently came up with an idea for a D&D character I will be playing in a campaign with some friends, and decided I wanted to sculpt her. I used Photoshop's Firefly to generate a few different ideas of what she might look like, collaged some parts of the images together, and then used the result as a concept for the sculpting.

"	"I'm a graphic designer/web designer, with additional skills in web development. I typically work on a wide range of projects from logo design, branding system development, website design, packaging, presentations, motion graphics, and video production. I typically work in a very fast-paced environment with tight deadlines.
"	"I will sometimes use AI for small tasks to help jumpstart my creativity or come up with some baseline ideas, for example to come up with ideas for memorable headlines or taglines. I've used it for code a couple times, although its sometimes easier for me to just build things myself so that I can structure the code in accordance with my personal workflow. The majority of the AI that I use within my process is using generative AI for imagery. For example, every designer knows the feeling of finding the perfect image for their design, only to find out it wont fit right within the layout. With generative AI, I'm able to quickly extend image backgrounds, change the color of clothing, remove elements from the background, add objects that aren't there, etc. These are all tasks that would have taken hours worth of cloning or splicing parts of different images together in order to look at best, slightly unnatural. Now with generative AI, all this can be expertly completed in under a minute with incredible accuracy.
"	"The most recent project was designing album artwork that I created by using AI generated images from Adobe Firefly, I then spliced elements from them a bunch of images together to create a cohesive image. I used generative AI to add details that weren't there like flames and light effects, and to fix certain details on someone's face. For me, it was really exciting to see how all of this imagery was created just by simply imagining something in my head, me describing it, and then seeing it show up on the screen moments later, often better than I had even imagined it.

92	creativity_0092	Mix	3	I'm an artist and a writer with a PhD in	"That all sounds good, go ahead and proceed.
"	"Sure. I will say that, strictly speaking, my use is not professional. But this was covered already in the first phase of this, so I suppose it's alright. My primary use of AI tools outside of a work context is using them to support me as I run multiple table-top role-playing games. While I am not paid to do so, I do put a professional amount of effort into the games that I run, and each one requires a lot of creative effort and logistics in organizing and running them. AI, in my case Chat GPT, helps tremendously if used correctly with that sort of thing. Much of the time, I use it as a sort of rubber-ducky troubleshooting Plus, where I can bounce ideas off it. It usually doesn't have ideas that are quite up to snuff, but it serves as an alright foundation for expanding on the ideas. Additionally, it works well for organizing and information retrieval on the fly, because I can simply trust that it remembers things we have talked about, and later, I can ask it to remind me about details. Finally, I use programs and websites, such as Homebrewery, that allow you to create pages that mimic the style of official table top gaming books using a custom markdown system. I can copy-paste the entire body of instructions for that system and simply ask Chat GPT questions about it as we go. I am not great at learning via tutorial video or long-winded instructions and I prefer to just jump into a system and learn it on the go, preferably from someone who already knows it. In this way, chat GPT can become a sort of instant subject matter expert about anything I need it to be, and I can ask questions and get help only when I actually need it. 

AI being what it is, however, it has to be double-checked regularly of course.
"	"Sure. Traditionally, creative tasks actually have a lot of 'mental grunt work' so to speak. For instance, lets say I have an idea for a small village outside a town. My players are going to this village for whatever plot reason. I am a world-builder at heart, so when I create a location in a campaign, I want it to feel lived-in, real. This applies for anything creative I do, including creative writing as well. Now, before AI tools, I would need to come up with names and occupations, key locations in the village, things like that. I would have to actually think of all this stuff, which is fun and all, but it does cut in to time spent prepping things that matter a lot more for the campaign. With AI, I can just, completely on the fly, come up with a list of people in the village. Background characters who probably won't matter, but you never know what weird things your players might decide to fixate on. Basically, AI works as an improvisational crutch, so I don't have to be quite so quick with my thinking, but I also don't have to spend a lot of prep time coming up with specific ideas. Again, current AI has its flaws here, especially with names. It requires a lot of specific prompting, otherwise it tends to cycle through the same annoying generic names over and over again. But all-in-all, it is a time saver when used correctly.
"	"Yes, I have a perfect example that kind of ties together both the rubber-ducky troubleshooting aspect, and the mental grunt work thing. Recently, my players were going through a planned encounter (Im running a Ghosts of Saltmarsh campaign, and they were going through the 'haunted house' in the Sinister Secrets of Saltmarsh module) when I was struck with an idea to homebrew an additional dungeon. Without going into too much detail, this manor used to be owned by an alchemist, and I ended up coming up with this idea in my head of this alchemist being sort of like the fantasy version of a DARPA think tank, creating magical and alchemical weapons for the kingdom. Anyway, as this idea was something I came up with on short notice, I used AI to help me come up with ideas for the layout of the dungeon and come up with unique trap ideas tailored to the theme and character of the former owner. The AI came up with some clever ideas, but they were very rough and didn't make a lot of sense when you really thought them through. However, with further refinements of the ideas, both by careful AI prompting and good old fashioned thinking about it in the shower, I managed to flesh them out in an interesting way. My players actually ended up breezing through them hilariously quickly, but everybody agreed it was still a fun session.

"	"I build pedals from scratch. This means I often choose a tried and true circuit and expand upon it or change it some way to make it my own. I then either purchase an enclosure or make it. Then, I make wood faceplate that is slightly smaller than the face of the enclosure, and I stain it and finish it nice and smooth. Then, I apply waterslide decals with graphics I've created and seal them in with more coats of finish. I do all the work myself, including making the PCBs out of stripboard, drilling all my enclosures, and doing all of the soldering and component purchasing myself. I sell them. I make custom ones often, as well, and what started as a hobby quickly grew into a business where I repair electronics faster than they can be picked up by the customers, and I sell so many of my original pedals I rarely have any of my own to play around with. I spend a lot of time on each project; probably more than is necessary. It's impossible, honestly, to get the hours for each pedal down. It's a week at least, with 12-hour days sometimes, and only 4-hour days other times.
"	"Sometimes it's as simple as coming up with new names for controls or effects, but sometimes it's also about understanding parts of a circuit I may not understand correctly. Usually, it's to better understand elements of electrical engineering in which I'm lacking. That said, I'd really like to utilize it for Bill of Materials compilations, circuit theory (testing?), as well as providing me with the best of the abundance of sources for components. Also, awareness of existing circuits. Almost like, a wizard librarian with his eye out for the best price and the most up-to-date info on component availability, and if not, what actually is suitable, including alternate pinouts if applicable, etc.
I feel like I am dyslexic with signal flow, as well as understanding some concepts that might seem basic. In particular, I am developing a synthesizer, and I have a harder time understanding things like when a summing amp is necessary and when it isn't. Or, another example might be discussing diode clipping and cascades...knowledge about what different diode configurations are known to produce is helpful so I know if I'm barking up a tree that's been barked up to much. As far as interactions go...I feel like I get some practical understanding out of the conversation, but my confidence is still kind of low. What if the info is wrong?
"	"A practical example is asking how to get PCB files to order PCBs without the usually necessary gerber file. I have, in the example, a jpg or pdf of a PCB layout, and a complete BOM; how do I proceed? I got stiffed by someone years ago and I'm trying to reverse engineer their work. I have my business name literally copyrighted on the image of the PCB layout...I just don't have the gerber. The instruction was to recreate the layout from scratch, which was ultimately what I had to do, and the resources for that were helpful too. I then kind of proceeded to learn how easy it was to use EasyEDA with AI. It took about a year, but now I'm making them with no problems thanks to that one conversation. It kind of set me off from converting my stripboards to proper PCBs for the final sale models.

A typical project for ghost writing is to get a topic, double check the requirements for both the client and if there's any middle management, do the research, and write the article, typically between 500-2000 words, depending. Research usually takes a few hours, and writing usually takes an additional hour. Novels are significantly more involved, as you can imagine. Each novel is different, but a simplified version of a project overview would be to outline, research, create a first draft, edit, research, rewrite, create a second draft, and repeat until something is ready to be handed over to betas.

For example, when I'm struggling with spelling, I'm able to give AI the definition, and it can tell me the word I'm trying to use. Or when I'm trying to find the correct word for something, for example a piece of architecture or an uncommon piece of furniture, when I know what the thing is, but I'm having difficulty communicating it properly. AI is excellent for taking the description and finding the correct words for me.
"	"Currently, I'm working on a novel that takes place in a fantasy world, but set in a time similar to our Roman era in western civilization. So, research has been key on that, making sure it is as authentic as possible. AI in particularly is helpful in that kind of area because not only can it give me sources that are usually fact checked and reliable, but it is also aware of how I'm applying that research (ie, into a fantasy world), and can make note when something might not be very applicable, or when something might be uniquely relevant to my fictional world. As far as how it feels, it feels less stressful to have that kind of research buddy, and its encouragement always helps me not feel discouraged when the research itself isn't turning over what I might have hoped.

97	creativity_0097	Content writing	2	I work on writing research style blogs t	"sounds good!
"	"I'm a web developer and software developer, web apps and android apps primarily. A typical project is setting up a business website or a website for one of the apps I'm developing, creating content for it from graphics to blog articles and writing copy that converts lookers into customers.
"	"I rely heavily on AI tools for content creation, a lot of working on the main pages in the site relies on copy that converts and AI helps me A/B test and find something that fits the feel of the site. I use it for programming and occasionally graphics but primarily marketing copy is where I lean heavily on AI.
"	"I used AI most recently to come up with and then refine the landing page copy for a client who runs a tattoo studio. She wanted something that fits her style so I told AI about her and the specific project goals and the task of writing the main copy. I work through it from top to bottom and then go back through again to find weaknesses and identify ways it could be better. It makes me feel a bit more confident in the marketing copy before I hand it over to a client but there are also issues like sounding too cliche or not finding the right tone.
Ok so I start typically with describing the client and goals and such and then ask for the very first line on the website and really refine it before going much further because it sorta sets the tempo. I then go on from there to each individual section whether its telling about features of a SaaS product or describing the tattoo studio or business and who they serve. basically I ask for copy that converts for each section. once I get  something I feel confident with I start a new conversation or choose a new model and send it through and ask for critical feedback pros and cons. I use that feedback as guidance for the replacement text, explaining why I like parts the model picked as not great or highlighting areas I don't like. I then ask for two or three versions depending on how I feel about it. The goal being to find issues before it gets to the client and sometimes I'll use multiple models to bounce ideas around and brainstorm ways to improve it

"	"It is my hobby, and something I spend a lot of time doing, which is researching and writing, about all sorts of topics. A typical project would be anything from a personal interest, or something in current affaris, a philosophy - generally any topic I'm curious about - becoming something I study, almost accademically and then write about. Its a cathartic way of helping me understand myself and the world around me more fully. My neurodiversity has held me back somewhat in the past, but now I'm overcoming those obstacles, I'm re-framing this personal journey as something I can re-orient into creating things to help others like me, get on in the world better. In a sense, give them some of the assistance I could have done with when I was younger.
"	"In the past, due to my ASD, I focused in on a range of topics of interest, researched them, and wrote about them, or produced some guide or flow chart - like a process of helping me understand the world and myself. This was really messy, un-focused, the topics were random and often I didn't finish them. I improved my work flow as an adult, higher education and work experience gave me skills that improved this hobby. It wasn't until AI came along though that I've seen a noticable difference in my output. I can use a range of AI tools now to help me research that save me so much time. Brainstorming ideas, checking for bias, validating information, cross checking data, finding the right words or ways to phrase a concept, untangling metaphore, exploratory thinking, advice... so much more, I could write a lot about how AI fits into my creative process. But to put it simply, it helps me untangle and present all the things I'm curious about in the world, that I think may be of interest or use to others, turning a mess of ideas into something useable.
"	"Yes, as part of my own journey, I'm making moves to improve my health and weight loss is one of the goals. Naturally I need to understand more about health, nutrition, exercise etc to help me lose weight, I can't just pick a diet and follow a schedule, I need to understand whats going on with me physiologiclaly - how ever complex or detailed that is. I never found anyone with the patients to listen to all my questions and go over and over details until they make sense to me, so in terms of how it felt for me - its like having the guide or teacher in my life now that I always needed. This project helped me understand so much more about how my body works. I've been able to probe and query so many things that it would have taken me hours - weeks maybe to research on my own. I feel gratitude, and I'm feeling a sense of acomplishment for what its done for me with this project so far, I'm still in the middle of this one though, so I'm hoping those feelings are magnified again by the end of it.

99	creativity_0099	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"That all sounds fine to me
"	"Well, I work in a couple of areas. One is graphic design where I need to create personalised prints and designs, the other is written. The written work is normally a presentation that needs to fit a particular theme or piece of writing. usually religious in nature. It may sometimes be an application for a grant or fund. Research is very important in order to ensure that the written work has integrity. The writing needs to be informative, engaging and connect with people in a way that hopefully leaves them feeling changed in some way.
"	"I still feel that AI is lacking a bit for the visual process, it appears to struggle when it comes to using fonts and writing. It's really helpful for the writing process. I can use it to give me inspiration. For example providing an idea, theme or piece of writing to the model, it often then provides some insights or thoughts. It's particularly helpful to bounce ideas off, check if certain thoughts or insights are factually accurate, or to help build on ideas. Sometimes, if I have a bit of a block and I don't know where to go next, I can upload what I have and ask for some ideas for what is is missing from the written piece.
It may be asking about historical context for a piece of writing (particularly religious writing). Often this may lead to asking further questions about specific people, cultures, religions or practices. This all feeds into gaining a deeper understanding of the piece of writing that is being studied. An example of this may be starting with ""give me the historical context of 'passage x'"". The response from the model may lead me on to the follow up question ""Tell me more about y"". Alternatively I may ask the model to rephrase a certain part of my writing to make it clearer, or ask if what I have included in my writing is factually accurate.
"	"A recent project began with my question ""why did Paul feel the need to write these words to the church in Thessaloniki 'make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands, just as we told you, 12 so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody.'""  This question began the process for me to understand more of what the passage was trying to say, rather than what may at first appear obvious to a modern day western reader. It helped me to get inside the mind of the author of the text. The information provided helped me to begin to find areas of interest and relevance that I could then hang a presentation on, ensuring that I was not misrepresenting the intended message. It was incredibly helpful. Not only did it help give me a starting point, but it also meant that I had a good amount of evidence and information to support my angle.
"
100	creativity_0100	Audiovisual	4	I'm a musician, so my projects range fro	"Sounds great. Let us begin.
"	"I do acting and comedy and I am involved in a lot of behind the scenes/backstage work as well in both film and theater. A typical project is a gig for me frankly. I am being brought into a team to perform a particular role because of my distinct abilities.
"	"I primarily engage AI tools to help me deal with administrative tasks and paperwork, filling forms when I am applying for jobs, keeping on top of my paperwork for my union membership, tailoring my resume and portfolio, managing my calendar and schedule.
"	"I recently helped to design a set for a comedy video/podcast. I had done some drawings as mock ups to show the client what it would look like, but they were unsatisfied with the work I had done. So I transferred my drawing into a AI and was able to make it into a realistic, 3d image and was able to convince the client and make some important changes. We used that image to run green-screen screen tests and give the client a chance to play in the space and see how it would look on camera before we committed to building the set.  I was frustrated at first with how the AI tool handled rendering my drawing however, the experience helped me to learn how to better prompt the model to get desired results.
It is a rather specific thing, but when you mention to a model to NOT include some element, it would invariably show up. It's like dealing with humans and you tell them to not think of a pink elephant. Do you get my drift? Elements that I didn't want included, I did not even mention. Because for example I would tell it, ""get rid of the bust of Shakespeare""; The bust would appear in every iteration even after explicit requests to remove it.
It was kind of annoying but it is like learning to deal with any other personality. I will admit that I caution a lot of people to be careful and sparing in using AI tools because of this, often they will not get what they want at first because they have not bothered to learn how to prompt engineer and will either become frustrated or end up producing work that is ""good enough"" but contains other flaws or errors that they had not been paying attention to at all.
""short attention span errors"" for example, you generate an image of a waiting room with potted plants. the issue is that they are not real plants and only bear passing resemblance to real potted plants but you'd only notice if you're looking for more than a split second. A lot of people in Comedy generate posters for shows using AI tools to avoid dealing with graphics software like Photoshop or Gimp, but also create posters where the comedian doesn't look anything like their avatar, they have a double headed mic or extra fingers. It look good enough to the user because they had some ideas about what they wanted to see but neglect details that the end user (the people they are trying to convince to come to their show) will see and judge them on. I am sure you know there is a virulent anti AI sentiment in a lot of the creative world.

101	creativity_0101	Mix	3	I'm an artist and a writer with a PhD in	"That sounds great, I have no questions!
"	"I am a full time wedding photographer so I use many tools to help me in the various stages of my projects. With my clients, I typically help plan some of their wedding details and do correspondance, which I use AI to help with. Creatively, I get to use AI in a lot of my marketing - like creating content for social media or blogs for my website - and in the post-production process of selecting, editing, and delivering the client's wedding photos.
"	"My job is naturally quite creative since not only it deals with the art of photography, but as an entrepreneur I feel my approach to ""doing business"" is creative. I find I use AI most when I am brainstorming, iterating ideas, trying to communicate to associates and clients, create effective and passive workflows, and especially with marketing. I like to have conversations frequently where I state my objective or intended outcome and then have the AI ask me questions, gain deep knowledge understanding about my approach or perspective, and then help me create the path to obtain my objective. For example, when using AI for creating Instagram content, I will first extensively train the AI on my tone of voice, brand values, mission, objectives, workflows, and more. I typically will say something like ""I need you to help me create my Instagram content for my wedding photography business. I'm trying to reach (this type of person) and get them to (do this thing like book a wedding package). Here's what I want my content to look like or sound like. Here are some difficulties I face."" And then before I let it help me, I tell it to ask me questions to gain better understanding from me of what it may need to accomplish the task. I will do this with other things - such as creating a new client experience or package. Sometimes I will do a similar approach to help me practice sales calls or create a new script.  Really the possibilities here are endless.

I also will use it to edit copy on my website, or to review the copy I have and tell me if it's in a good order for the ""customer journey"" and ask if there's something I can change to have more impact. I like to think of all AI use as a collaboration. I provide the intended outcome and have the AI help me better define that outcome and the supporting details. Then I provide the initial idea or the draft version and then use the AI to help me see my ""blind spots"". I iterate my thoughts about the blind spots it pointed out and then it helps me come up with solutions. I will spend extensive amounts of time on many tasks using AI and think it has improved my quality of output in every way and arena of business. 

I also use tools that are AI powered, but not the typical ""chat bot"" AI. I use programs that will AI select a desired amount of images from 10k images from a wedding for example based on certain qualities I'm looking for. It will select the best of the images, include one of every grouping from family photos, omit everything that has closed eye, or follow the other instructions  given. I use a program that will auto edit all of my images to a certain style that is trained based on my past images. I have a program that delivers the images AI sorted by individual in the images. The longer I think about it the more uses I realize I use AI for.
"	"I am in the process of extending my business to include ""Lifestyle Photography"" which is like family photos. Instead of just integrating it into the current business I have I decided it needs to be it's own standalone thing - really so that my wedding business doesn't become in-cohesive and watered down. In the earliest stages I think AI helped me come to this conclusion when I was confused about how to fuse the two together. But this overhaul that I'm still currently in has required that I look through every corner of my business and convert my business assets (like pdf guides, onboarding documents, contracts, website copy, portfolio blogs, sales scripts) into a version that communicates my lifestyle photography objectives and services. Some of that has been more administrative and editorial in nature, but overall I ""outsource"" a lot of the decision brainstorming and idea creation to AI because it's an overwhelming and idea-heavy process. Since I train my AI chats with things like my mission statement or values or desired outcome, when I present an idea or problem I find that it will consider the impact to that ""bigger vision"" more easily and consistently than I do. When it knows in such detail my entire business or even just my client experience, I find that when I do even really quick chats like ""how should I respond to this email"" it gives a very well considered and thorough answer. But this use of AI for the ""creation"" stages of things provides me so much more freedom to pursue the best ideas well and abandon the not so great ones early.

102	creativity_0102	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"No questions, let's begin!
"	"I'm a writer and editor, so my flow varies a lot from project to project, but generally it goes like this:
-I go over the initial version of the project, be it notes I took on a show or movie or a rough draft someone else sends me, like a blog post or a manuscript. I take it in and make any obvious edits, like fixing typos or grammar mistakes, or rephrasing things that don't quite sound right.
-I typically like to wait a while before proceeding with the next step, which is thinking over the whole project and how the major ideas fit together. This often involves me rearranging whole paragraphs, cutting and moving chunks of text, more intricate rephrasing, and sometimes adding headers to break up lengthy web posts. If I'm drafting an original post, it usually looks like me organizing thoughts into distinct categories and then weaving them together so they sound like they flow together naturally. If there are a lot of notes and the thoughts are hard to keep track of, I may color-code them to make it easier. If I'm doing something like editing a manuscript, this is where I might make more overarching story or character notes in the margins as I read.
-The final step is to read the whole thing through again and polish it up, making sure that all my edits flow naturally and make sense, and, if it's not my work, that it still sounds like the original author. If I'm editing a manuscript, this is where I'll type out a letter highlighting what I think are the most crucial areas that need looking at. 
-If I'm editing or writing something for the web, the last step is to go through and do basic SEO edits.
"	"Rarely, if ever, do I use AI in the creative process itself - I enjoy writing and I generating the basics takes the fun out of it for me. What I do use it for is to keep track of character and setting notes in original fiction and when reading complex manuscripts: My notes are often messy and disorganized, and when I was younger I often found myself wishing I could have some sort of Clippy-esque assistant that would just be able to read through my notes and answer any question I had directly. This is especially useful in works with a lot of characters or places to keep track of - doubly so for fictional ones with no other reference material for those things.
"	"I was writing a scene in a fantasy setting that contained dozens of potential character interactions - I'm co-writing a novel with another author in a sort of literary roleplay-type format, so there are a number of potential interactions that could happen at any given time. I was able to use an AI assistant to go through the names and place them in different areas of a large palace ballroom and social scene, and then to move them around naturally as the scene continued. There is no way I could have pulled off the true randomness of the interactions and character groupings without such a tool, and the resulting scenes would not have been nearly as interesting as what we produced.

103	creativity_0103	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"No, I'm ready to begin!
"	"I work on creating inspiration and client-facing artifacts for housing remodel. This includes interior and exterior remodeling. I work with with contractor managing the job to create mock-ups to present to the client with design inspiration and remodeling options. Some of examples of exterior remodeling could be changing paint colors, railings, or landscaping while interior could be updating design concepts or reworking internal room dimensions.
"	"Currently AI only fits well into the preliminary stages of my work. I use AI to brainstorm ideas for different design choices using images, creating images of what theoretical rooms could look like and creating mood boards with different ideas to give clients a lot of variety.
"	"For example, my most recent use was creating options for exterior railings. I was given multiple pictures of the exterior of a home and my job was to create a portfolio of images of different railings on each angle of the house to give the client a book of options to choose from. AI models in the design space are still somewhat limited. They couldn't complete the job of pasting railings onto a house without altering the original picture significantly, but I did use them to give me examples of railings on coastal houses with similar themes. I took those AI inspiration railings and found realistic images that I was able to photoshop onto my original pictures for client mock-ups.
I've tried multiple different AI models and each have similar limitations. For my purposes, clients want to see what these different design choices look like on their exact house. When AI models are generating, they often struggle with instructions to only change specific artifacts in an image and instead change the entire image. For example, when I use the prompt ""change the exterior railings from aluminum to wrought iron, use a design popular on high-end coastal vacation homes, do not change any other aspect of the image, the rest of the house should stay exactly the same"" I will receive back a new AI generated home, possibly with the correct railings but usually with distorted proportions. If I was starting with a blank canvas, the generative AI models would be very helpful. The issue is that the current generation will change the structure of the house significantly so that it's not the same as original photo. This creates images that aren't what the client is looking for so I can't use them for end stage design presentations.

I write my own articles on Medium, where I mostly publish about topics that interest me like philosophy, mental heal, literature and feminism. I sometimes write articles for other people, mostly ghost-written SEO content, although not so much nowadays. I also write creatively in my free time. I haven't done so yet, but I plan to submit my short stories for publication to literary journals and magazines. Sometimes, I take part in creative writing competitions (short stories and flash fiction). I take on editing/proofreading/beta reading projects whenever I can—this is where I have the most experience. Some of my work is paid, and some is voluntary. For example, right now, I am beta reading fiction for free as I wanted experience editing and providing feedback on fiction. Most of my paid work is for non-fiction and academic articles.
"	"I try not to use it for anything to do with my writing. I prefer to use it for admin and some more mathematical issues like working out my taxes, earnings, savings, schedule, etc. Writers wrote before this tool was available, and my core desire is to be a good writer. I don't think AI can help me to become a better writer. At most, I'll use it for a final check before publication, or if I'm feeling bad about my writing, I might use it for a confidence boost. I won't let AI change or edit my writing, just provide feedback. And I only use this for blogging and never my creative fiction. As for editing, if I'm struggling with wording for feedback, I might use AI to help me reword feedback. I do this sparingly, however. I would use it to help my tone come across better when giving feedback so I don't offend authors.
"	"I would use it if I'm feeling unconfident about an article. I simply copy it into a chat and ask for feedback. I tell the model strictly not to edit or change anything, act as a reader and tell me what it 'thinks.'

"	"Any time I need an answer that would take too long or be too difficult to find on Google
Here's an example: trying to determine how much licensed archival footage costs on average would be almost impossible on Google, because I would be faced with advertisements, disparate information, and overviews that don't give me the level of specificity needed to answer the question. That's what I think AI models are best at - synthesizing information into a clear, direct, and coherent response that saves me a lot of time.
"	"This is a more creative application, but I needed to generate a cover for the film treatment and I used an AI model to help generate the images that I then positioned in a specific way in order to create the scene (they were plants and small animals that adhered to a very specific aesthetic style). I've found that when requesting something like this, you need to be very specific and explain the most important elements that you want. Then, once a style has been established, the model does a great job of replicating that style across all subsequent prompts (if requested)

For screenwriting I often work with a writing partner.

"	"Recently we were preparing a one-sheet for an idea that we had not fully fleshed out. We looked at using AI for design but utilising free tools did not give us the quality we needed. We also asked for a precis of our idea but ended up using that. In the end the only thing we used AI for was to come up with alternatives for a closing sentence that we just couldn't quite get right.
It felt a little rushed and didn't have the right personality for the genre of project. It felt a little lifeless. We have used it before to offer suggestions for a one-pager and foudn the results were great and gave us inspiration for redrafting but in this case, it served a different purpose and made us realise that our current one-sheet synopsis was already working very well.

"	"When starting a project, sometimes I need help estimating how much yarn I'll need. I'll send information regarding the size of needles/hooks I plan to use, the weight of the yarn, what size I want the piece to be, and it will give me a close estimate. I also use AI if I get confused with the pattern and need some expertise on it. Additionally, I occasionally use AI to help me word messages to buyers regarding items they're interested in.

I gave information on the weight of the yarn, the size of the needles, and how many stitches I used for the front panel, and it gave me a helpful suggestion.
I've used AI in the past to help with precise knitting questions, and it often gives more general answers to avoid wrongful suggestions, so I was a little reluctant. However, I tried out casting on a number of stitches at the higher end of the range it suggested and the result so far seems to be working well.

For example I might tell it that I am planning a stream on a particular topic and ask for suggestion for assets to promote that stream.

I often use AI assistance within Photoshop to clean up small issues in an image, like the smart fill to remove a defect from a background. Occasionally I will use AI image gen to give me inspiration on color palettes or basic layouts for a design that I can use to base my own designs on. I frequently use Udio to create lo-fi background music for my live streams. And I use ChatGPT almost daily for executive function related tasks like to-do lists or breaking down big projects into smaller pieces. I have ADHD, so having a LLM as my executive assistant really helps me complete projects I might lose track of otherwise, or prioritizing what things to work on first.
"	"Sure, I am helping my husband develop a TCG (trading card game) based off of an original IP. Neither of us really know a ton about TCGs, and I have only casually played a couple like Hearthstone and Pokemon. I used AI to assist me in talking through our ideas for the game and how to make the rules and gameplay loop unique while still keeping things familiar and easy to pick up for those who play a lot of TCGs. Over the course of a couple of days, it helped me refine our ideas into a full v1 draft of a rule book with all the basic card types and how they work planned out. My next step in that project is to use AI to help me create a spread sheet of different ability effects frequently found on cards in games like these, so I can adapt them to our game's lore and start making a card list as the next step.

Oh, and I should mention I'm a freelancer. That's why I'll end up working with a variety of  topics. If I receive too little info to work with but have a requested content length, then I use AI to get creative and fill in the gaps, while still ensuring that everything stated is accurate
"	"For example, a client asked me to write makeup blogs for her products. Of these, a few times I was only provided with a picture and the name of the product. 700 words based on just that?? So, I used AI to brainstorm and compile info about the company (its objectives, history, ingredients, etc).

111	creativity_0111	Content writing	2	I work on writing research style blogs t	"Okay! I don't have any questions so far.
"	"I work as professional freelance copy and content writer. I write ads for clients, landing pages, blog posts, write some for social media, a lot of different things. A typical project includes every step from brainstorming the idea with the client, to extensive competitor research, to creating the ad/web page/blog, proofreading/editing, and finalizing all deliverables.
"	"I usually lean on AI for the brainstorming and research portion, and then again for the proof-reading and editing.
If I'm starting a new project, like a blog for example, and the topic is rather broad, I'll first tell AI the general outline for the project I have in my head and ask the model to identify any gaps and expand on my outline.
Usually, I'll have them incorporated into the outline with a little bit of personal tweaking. Then I'll continue the process until I feel like I have a full outline. Often, the AI is TOO comprehensive for my required word counts and I find myself cutting out bits of the outline as I actually write the piece.
"	"Recently, I wrote an entire landing page for a brand new health teach startup that had just launched their new health tracking app and community platform. I had NO idea what beats I should hit on the final landing page, it was the first time I had written one in this niche or for this type of product, so I first had the AI assistant outline a basic skeleton for the page. And then as I started filling in areas, sent my finished text back to be polished and placed into the outline. As I wrote, the outline started to evolve.
I would realize the next section of the outline was too broad or too deeply technical, and I would issue the corrections to the model. Then I would write the section based off the updated outline.

"	"Of course. I am an illustrator who currently focuses on medieval-woodcut inspired pen and ink illustrations. I sell prints online, in person at local art markets, and I accept commissions. I have been a working artist for over a decade now. I have previously worked 4 years as a professional tattoo artist, taking appointments and walk-in clientele, with a focus on American Traditional style tattoos. My typical projects are usually punk and nature inspired imagery, done with staedtler 1.2mm pens on paper, though I am looking to branch out into dip pens or even linocut/woodblock printing as my business grows.
"	"I use a lot of large language models for assistance with website copy, drafting artist statements, brainstorming social media marketing, and sometimes (though rarely) illustration ideas. Basically, the more tedious and less creative parts of running an art business. I would rather be spending my time drawing. I will tap into an AI tool maybe a few times a week for creative assistance.
"	"I launched a new brand in June, so I had AI draft my website copy for me, though I did go in and edit it to sound more like my personal voice. I am a bit shy about admitting my use of AI to other creatives in my industry. Otherwise, most recently, I've put together some art supply lists.
I understand that the use of AI does require a lot of environmental resources, and large scale data centers popping up are using a ton of fresh water and electricity. I'm very much concerned about climate change and its effects, so I do sometimes feel bad using it for quick jobs. However, I also recognize that there is a lot of incredible potential with certain AI tools. I hope in the near future, these environmental concerns can be addressed.

113	creativity_0113	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"Sounds good. No questions.
"	"I am a multi-disciplinary creative. I come from a family of artists. I am a film maker by profession. My skills revolve around shooting and editing digital footage. I have worked on a range of projects from feature films, documentaries, music videos, ads and online content. Recently I have also completed professional programs in VFX and Technical Arts. 

A typical project depends on the type. If it is a film or video project, it involves logging and cataloguing footage first. Then I build a narrative based on the story. The creative element comes in cutting clips together into a coherent story. There is a distinct visual grammar that changes with each edit, and this evolves as the narrative is crafted. It is one of the more dynamic and challenging natures of film montage.

For 3D projects such as personal artwork and game development, I first gain an understanding of the brief and then I proceed with creating 3D models along with textures. The detail in these artworks depends on the use case. There will be a higher poly count for personal artwork, but a lower poly count with more optimization for game engines. It all starts with a 3D doodle, which I then slowly refine into the finished work.

As a creative my first priority is to get into the mindset of the brief and to develop a workflow that lets art evolve into the finished piece.
"	"I find myself constantly using AI. Many 3D art pieces are based on realistic measurements and there are certain terms that help define what I need to make or what I need to illustrate. For example, for a project creating a realistic camera lens, I used AI to obtain the measurements of a micro 4/3 mount. In another project, I needed the history of medieval times to understand their architecture and what was relevant during certain time periods.

I have also used AI for help in coding python tools within Maya. It is very helpful when I am stuck and need another perspective. Coming from a non-coding background, as an artist working with complex software, this is immensely helpful in automating certain tasks. It also helps to troubleshoot issues within creative software.

The most useful AI has been is in learning new techniques. I would simply ask how to do a certain task in a software, and it would detail the process saving me a lot of time.
"	"I am working on a sci-fi watch project. Another useful thing about AI is that it can help filling in gaps or weaknesses in a skill-set. I am not as good in setting up and composing or laying out a scene. With AI I was able to get some quick mock-ups and concepts of how I can place objects. While it is not perfect, this is what makes it more 'human,' where there is deliberation and re-iteration through the process.

"	"I have lots of creative projects, mostly involved with audio and video content creation. My video projects are typically promo videos for the church I work for. They feature service projects or identity statements.
"	"I use AI tools for planning and scripting. As most of my videos have time restrictions, I use AI to make sure my plan will fit in the constraint. I also use it to help brainstorm content like b-roll or settings. I also run either my script or outline through AI to clean and tighten it while trying to maintain my voice.
"	"Sure. I created a promo video for our mobile food pantry that was a shorter version of a previous video. I used AI to talk through the most essential elements to communicate and how to pare down the script for a tight one minute promo.
I gave the voice over from the longer video to the model and asked it to identify what it thought were the most important elements. I then told it what were the important elements for me and asked it to create a one minute script from those details that fit the voice and identity of the church.
"
115	creativity_0115	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"Absolutely! Let's go!
"	"I think like a lot of creatives, I have multiple projects going simultaneously. I'm not a narrow-focus creative who does one type of work and that's it - I write, I edit, I do multimedia crafts, painting, extremely niche restoration techniques, I do graphic design, printing, and even some web design. I do a lot of experimenting and testing - most projects involve some level of learning on the fly. Other than straightforward printing, there's no ""typical project flow.""
"	"Lately I've been using it to do some research on new techniques - maybe I heard someone mention something in passing that I've never done, and I'll do a surface level recon on my own and think it MIGHT fit in my skill sets/abilities. I'll have a chat with an AI to see what other chatter is out there, and see if I'm overlooking potential pitfalls implementing that with the tools I have. For example, I asked about waterslide decals one time after hearing about it - it seemed like a good potential fit for some restoration work, but after deeper AI conversations combined with my practical knowledge, I determined it probably wouldn't be viable with the printer I have now. Better to find out via chat with an AI than to try it on an important project and ruin it with running ink.
"	"Yes! I found some plush patterns I was iterating on in a huge backlog - probably ten years they had been waiting for me to get time to finish them. I had no notes or ideas about what I was going to do to finish it. The body was stuffed, but it had no eyes, and I was out of inspiration at that moment. I shared a WIP picture and asked the AI what color would look good. I expected just a text response, but the AI actually edited my picture and put eyes on the plush. I was a little surprised, then impressed, and then I looked at the eyes more closely. They looked like googly eyes you might glue on a sock puppet, not polished eyes you would actually put on a soft plush animal. I was disappointed once I thought about it a little more - just the text would have been fine in that case instead of making my work look goofy.
I do very intricate hand-embroidered and appliqued eyes - not a plastic ""punch through and done"" type, which is what the edited image looked like. The plush was already sewn up and stuffed, and the level of craftsmanship should have been a hint that gluing plastic eyes on top was inappropriate.

"	"I'm a professional voice actor. A typical project (assuming that I've already auditioned and have been cast) involves me recording my lines, being directed and depending on if there is an engineer, doing some light editing before final delivery. I'll get a script and then record it according to the specifications whether it's a character script, commercial or narration. The length of the process depends on how long the script is and can range from as short as 5 minutes to a few hours.
"	"As voice acting is a creative profession where the human element is really important, I will not use AI much during the middle of the recording process. For that aspect, I would prefer to do everything myself to maintain authenticity. What I will use AI for is purely for research, ideation and editing recorded audio. For example, if there are character references (ex: quirky scientist, tough cop, Chris Evans as Captain America) then I may consult AI to help me find example video clips or other character examples to help draw from. My audio editing software does have AI features which does help smooth out the AI process, but I will often have to double check their work to make sure they didn't do anything unnatural to the audio.
"	"Again, AI has a limited role during my work. Aside from the initial audition, after that, AI is really only used for the sake of editing. But for an example of what AI does during the audition process, there were vague specifications that the client wanted but was unable to truly highlight any examples (friendly, upbeat, kind of quirky). So I plugged their specifications into an AI assistant and it was able to point in the direction of TV show characters that were along the lines of something they may have wanted. There, it just truly felt like the AI was simply a better search engine and helps me maintain my integrity as an actor as I'm still making the majority of acting decisions for myself. It is very important to me that AI is only a supplement to my work, never a replacement.

"	"I use AI to facilitate my business. I use AI for SEO and writing listing descriptions.
I will use an AI service or just a chat model to help me come up with tags for my Etsy listings. Etsy has specific parameters for tagging listings, so I use AI to try to come up with product tags that will promote my listings

AI:
I'll also provide brief descriptions of my products to have AI generate product listing descriptions with keywords. They're usually not very good, but they give me a good starting point. Or I can pick out some good phrases from the response.
They usually sound very formulaic, like you can tell they were written by a robot. They don't have much personality, and I feel like my art has personality. The responses sound sterilized.  I usually will copy & paste the whole response and edit it to sound more personable. I keep the keywords that help with SEO or performance, but I edit out the filler stuff that sounds cookie cutter. 
"	"I feed the AI a concept, and it helps me spitball similar ideas, but I still have to make the art. There's no visual or graphic creation, just discussion.
"
118	creativity_0118	Mix	3	I'm an artist and a writer with a PhD in	"Nope.
"	"I have several facets of creative work that I function in, but they essentially boil down to writing and audio engineering. For writing, my process is very flexible. I used to begin with an outline and then work my way through it chronologically, but lately I have been piecemealing sections of text together as they cross my mind. AI has been especially helpful for this latter technique. I also write eBay listing descriptions. For this, I used to cut and paste old descriptions into new listings and then change words as necessary, but AI has helped cut down this process significantly, especially when it comes to describing images based on the pictures. As for audio engineering, this process entail recording tracks of sound, mixing it and mastering it. AI has come to help me hone in on higher quality sound by making suggestions of how to sculpt audio per my intentions when I seem to hit a wall.
"	"I have an ongoing conversation with a model that I will open. Per the initial system instructions, it knows to transcribe what I say, while cutting out artifacts like ""uh"" or ""um"" and keeping the grammar correct while changing as few words as possible and ideally no words at all. I use this method for prose projects. Later I will go to a desktop and copy the transcribed sections over to a master word document.  I also have used AI to flesh out the story for a script I am working on. Helping me hone in on details that can most realistically connect the story's events while firming up a solid order of events.
"	"Well I just described two writing projects where AI served as a transcriber, light editor and writing partner. As for audio, I recently mixed a live show and was having trouble getting the kind of definition I wanted. I described my tracking set up and the model gave me specific frequency cuts to make on specific tracks. This gave me the intended sound I was seeking and also taught me a new technique. This made me feel elevated, as though my expertise had increased, and with it my confidence.

119	creativity_0119	Audiovisual	4	I'm a musician, so my projects range fro	"Let's do it!
"	"I'm an independent musician-entrepreneur. This takes on many forms, such as producing music, recording other artists, mixing music, releasing music, marketing the projects, writing grants to secure funding, and so forth. Think of it like a single-person label.
"	"A majority of the time I use it for admin stuff - like tracking CPC on Meta Advertising campaigns or budgeting to buy new equipment. I've also found myself using quite a bit when writing lengthy applications to government funding, as well as ""copy"" about releases, such as playlist pitches to Spotify. The content generated in those conversations can usually be used in more than one place (artist statement, for example). On rare occasions, I've tried using LLMs to find the perfect turn of phrase in lyrics - but this isn't usually that helpful and I don't love doing it.
Well, the first obstacle is that it really isn't that good at it. I've tried a few different models and they always generate generic or non-applicable ideas. It's usually stuff that people would find 'corny' or uninspired. That's why I only really reach for it when I can ask for a really granular task that don't require idea generation or conceptual thinking, like ""Find a rhyme for XYZ"" or ""Write this sentence but only use 4 syllables"". For that stuff, it can be really helpful.
"	"Well I've used it to write the copy and press content (for music releases) that I submit to DSPs and playlist curators. It seems 'good enough', but I can't help think that it might be hurting my chances because so many people probably have similar pitches. Same goes for grant writing that describes my creative practices.

"	"Sure, I work as a seamstress, a project usually begins from the moment a customer comes to the store. I take measurements, if I'm currently working in store, if I am working from home then I just pick up garments and measurements from store.
"	"I use AI to run through ideas I have about certain projects, more so to have a trailing thought process and receive some feedback from it. If I am working in store, I tend not to use it as much because I can talk to colleagues about concerns or confusion.
"	"My most recent project, where I used AI, was to do some basic maths. I was tied up and used handsfree to ask for conversions. One of the given measurements was in a different unit to the rest, I asked for a conversion and briefly, for reasoning, to see if the new measurement in the new unit was on trend for the rest of the garment.
"
121	creativity_0121	Fiction writing	0	I'm a writer, primarily of science ficti	"That sounds great. I think I'm ready.
"	"I am a writer. I write fiction novels and short stories. I have been concentrating on one series, but I am thinking of branching out into other series and genres. Although some life circumstances have kept me from a healthy writing routine lately, usually what I do when I'm starting a project is brainstorm a situation, setting, and characters. If I am continuing a series (rather than starting a new one) I consider what has been happening up to this point, as well as where I want it to go. I don't tend to write a full point-by-point plotline, but rather rough out where I want to start. Then I write. I don't usually backtrack, but push through to the end of the first draft because if I stop and go back, it's harder to finish. If I think I'm missing something along the way, I make notes. After the first draft, I reread it and make more notes, then try to incorporate any changes / additions. I reread and edit at least one more time, but it could be more if I realize I've made a major error. Does that make sense?
"	"I would definitely use AI to help with the brainstorming. First of all, in a series it's very, very easy to lose track of characters, especially characters who are secondary in one book but might become primary in another. This is especially true in what I write, because I tend to write about small towns or other communities, so there are a lot of secondary characters. I want to develop a story bible that includes the characters and actions that have happened in previous books so I don't lose track. Books have character arcs, but so do series. I want the AI to help me plan out the series arc and then help me determine how to move forward. I tend to get stuck inside my own head and have a hard time wading through. I'd also like help developing the characters and maybe spin-off series, so I want the AI to help write sketches for that.  It's also very helpful for the AI to assist in editing, and also in the administrative/marketing tasks. I am an independent author, so I need to do all of the publishing tasks as well as the creation tasks. It is great that AI can help with that.
Sometimes I look at what's been done or the characters that are already created and I just can't see a way forward. I have a general ideal of where I want to end up, but I don't know how to start. That's when I tend to get caught in an endless loop of rewriting. I don't know how to get where I want to go, so I polish and polish and polish the text that's already written. I think AI can help break me out of that cycle.
"	"As I said, I haven't been working productively on my writing lately, but I want that to change. Mostly I've been using AI for brainstorming situations and characters just generally rather than sticking to a particular project or series. It's helping to open me up and see the possibilities again. It makes me feel hopeful that I'll be able to take back my creativity again. It's nice to have a creative partner who works with me and helps me see the options.
"
122	creativity_0122	Content writing	2	I work on writing research style blogs t	"That sounds good. I don't have any questions at this time.
"	"I am a freelance writer. I have written articles for online blogs, short magazine articles, and newspaper articles. I have also written many children's stories and published poems. My articles typically revolve around families or traveling with children from the ages of newborn to high school. My most typical projects lately are short stories and poems. I typically find my work online and adjust my writing to what is needed. My turn around time is typically 24-48 hours from the time I accept a job.
"	"I do not like to be repetitive in my professional writing but often have trouble coming up with names for characters. I have used AI to help with that, as well as to give me a quick backstory for a character I'm considering writing into my story. It is faster for me to have the AI do the backstory than for me to come up with all of the details on my own if I am under time constraints. I never use it to write the story. I love the personal creativity of writing but when the clock is ticking down I do like to use it as a helper.
"	"I was tasked with writing a short story for 7-8 year old children. I was hired by a school principal (also an acquaintance) that wanted something special for a class that was off to a bit of a rocky start with their school year. Their original teacher was only there for 2 days before leaving without notice. He had me write a story about sudden changes and resilience when things are a bit scary and uncertain. I bounced some ideas around with AI and had it help me create backstories for 3 of the main characters. I was struggling to explain to the kids in their own terms why a teacher might leave... or in this case, why a hedgehog needed to spread it's wings and that even when unexpected things happen, it can sometimes be a good thing.

123	creativity_0123	Art, design, crafts	1	I do a variety of creative work. I am se	"Sounds good. I don't have any questions.
"	"I create messaging and visuals for a state transportation agency's occupational safety division. We have to cover the same topics so the basic content doesn't change. The creativity is how to say the same thing, without it feeling like the same thing. I also create themes and collateral for our Safe Days of Summer Campaign and our state dump truck roadeo. I also have to think about content management, work flows and editorial calendars. January through August is usually pretty busy. I also do emergency weather response messaging for ice storms and hurricanes. September through December is usually planning activities.
"	"For the past couple of years I have used it to ideate content for our Safe Days of Summer campaign where we have 18 weeks of materials going out, from May 1 to Aug. 31. Each week we cover a new topic in a brief, video, email and webpage. The content is generally the same on each of those, but I have to reproduce that 18 times during the summer and present it in a cohesive way. So I'm usually given the overall theme some phrase, last year it was safety is a habit. This year it was safety in action. And I want to find novel ways to present the information so I ask AI how can we present this content in an interesting and engaging way? I also rely on AI when I'm staring at a blank page and I just need to get some ideas processing. Or if I'm given a bunch of topics that don't really relate to each other, I ask AI how they could be presented. For me it's more of a thinking tool than a writing tool. How do these pieces fit together? What is the best way to present the information that these people have seen a bazillion times?
"	"I am all for using AI. But my workplace is not so much. They are starting to wade into it. So I have to be careful on how much I'm using the tool. That said, I used it on formulating a outline for the safety and action campaign. It was based on movies. But our big boss is using purpose, practice, and people as his speaking theme for the year. I'm not sure where it came from. So we had to incorporate his purpose, practice, and people into this fun movie theme. And that kind of sucked. So again the AI was more of a thinker. Let's say the main topic for the week is hydration. The main idea was let hydration be your costar. We would have a safety brief with movie puns and  and how to hydrate and stay hydrated and then at the bottom of each brief, we would have purpose practice and people sections. Why do we hydrate? How do we hydrate? Who do we help by hydrating? So the very beginning of the project I didn't have any of this fleshed out. I ran it through AI many times to see how to connect the very corporate purpose practice people into the fun movie Summer Blockbuster, kind of theme. We got there eventually, but it took some time.

As a note, I am a very dedicated hobbyist writer and artist, and do not actually work for any particular company. I have been creating all my life. The qualification said that was acceptable, so I just want to specify!
"	"On a personal level, I am an artist that works with many different mediums! I use pencil, pen, oil paint, OPEN acrylics (slow drying), etc. I also draw digitally. When I create personal pieces, I enjoy a spontaneous direction with my work. Collaboratively with my partner, we write a fantasy alien story together! We have been working on it for over five years. We eventually want to make it a comic, and explore many other mediums to express our story as well. Mythological and queer themes are also present and integrated into our project.
"	"For visual art, I like to use AI for very loose conceptual ideas (such as color palettes), material research (used AI to help identify a vintage flake white oil paint the other week), and artform exploration (such as learning about obscure cultural techniques that are difficult to learn about). For writing, I use AI for very basic ideas such as learning about specific topics I want to write about but do not know how to structure (such as military power structures), looking for mythology to research, basic character concepts (such as animals to take inspiration from for character ideas), etc. With writing in particular, I like specific ideas to be anonymous when talking to an assistant for idea and concept security.
"	"My partner and I recently used AI for one of our characters. He takes a lot of inspiration from amphibians and reptiles, but recently we discovered a popular character who looks crocodilian, which was quite similar to some of our concepts. We had to go back to the drawing board because we do not want our characters to be compared like that (design-wise), and so we discussed mythology ideas and animal ideas in order to get inspiration.
It felt nice to get some more ideas, and it allowed us to discuss many of the suggestions on our own! We did not directly specify which ideas we liked to the assistant, so it doesn't know whether we liked or disliked a suggestion for our particular character.
